          <title>Objectives</title>
          <p>Generic health status measures such as the short form health survey (SF-36) and EuroQol-5D (EQ-5D) are increasingly being used to inform health policy. They are claimed to be applicable across disease areas and have started to be used within mental health research. This review aims to assess the construct validity and responsiveness of four generic health status measures in schizophrenia, including the preference-based SF-6D and EQ-5D.</p>
        </sec>
        <sec>
          <title>Method</title>
          <p>A systematic review of the literature was undertaken. Ten databases were searched from inception to August 2009 and reference lists scrutinized to identify relevant studies. Studies were appraised and data extracted. A narrative synthesis was performed of the evidence on construct validity including known groups validity (detecting a difference in health-related quality of life (HRQL) scores between two different groups such as samples from the general population and people with schizophrenia), convergent validity (strength of association between generic HRQL and other measures (e.g., symptom or functional), and responsiveness. Responsiveness was considered by: 1) differences in generic HRQL measure scores in responders/non-responders and 2) correlation between changes on generic HRQL measures and changes in specific measures obtained from patients and clinicians.</p>
        </sec>
        <sec>
          <title>Results</title>
          <p>Thirty-three studies were identified that provided data on the validity and/or responsiveness of the instruments. Most of the evidence concerns the SF-36 and EQ-5D, and for these instruments there was evidence for known group validity. The evidence for convergent validity and responsiveness was mixed, with studies presenting contradictory results.</p>
        </sec>
        <sec>
          <title>Conclusion</title>
          <p>Although the evidence base is limited in a number of important respects, including problems with the measures used to develop constructs in the validation studies, it is sufficient to raise doubts about the use of generic measures of health like the EQ-5D and SF-36 in patients with schizophrenia.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>Generic health status measures such as short form health survey (SF-36) and EuroQol-5D (EQ-5D) are increasingly being used to inform health policy. The last decade has seen the increased use of economic evaluation, particularly the use of cost-effectiveness analyses by agencies such as National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) to inform resource allocation decisions <xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>, where interventions are assessed in terms of their cost per quality adjusted life year (QALY). The QALY provides a way of measuring the benefits of health care interventions, including improvements in health-related quality of life (HRQL) usually measured using a generic measure like EQ-5D. There has been, however, only a limited use of generic measures of health in mental health <xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>.</p>
      <p>It is claimed that the EQ- 5D and other generic preference-based measures such as the SF-6D <xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref> are applicable to all interventions and patient groups. This claim has support in many physical conditions where these instruments have managed to pass psychometric tests of reliability and validity <xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>. For other conditions the claim has not be substantiated, such as in relation to visual impairment in macular degeneration <xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref> and hearing loss <xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>. Doubts have also been raised about the appropriateness of generic measures in mental health <xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>. One solution would be to use disease-specific HRQL measures, for example there have been attempts to derive preference-based measures from the positive and negative syndrome scale (PANSS) and clinical outcomes in routine evaluation – outcome measure (CORE-OM) <xref rid="bib8 bib9" ref-type="bibr">[8,9]</xref> in mental health. There are concerns, however, about the comparability of such disease-specific scales and in the United Kingdom, health technology assessment submissions to NICE are expected to follow the details outlined in the reference case analysis described by the NICE methods guide. This clearly stipulates that wherever possible and appropriate, the EQ-5D is the favored measure for generating utility values <xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>, thus allowing a common metric to assess health care interventions. Alternative measures may be used where the EQ-5D has been empirically demonstrated to be inappropriate in terms of their validity and responsiveness to change and several studies have been undertaken providing such evidence.</p>
      <p>In order to provide a reasoned assessment of the appropriateness of generic HRQL measures in patients with schizophrenia, we have undertaken a systematic review to investigate the construct validity and responsiveness of two generic HRQL profile measures (SF-36, SF-12) and two preference-based HRQL measures (SF-6D, EQ-5D) in schizophrenia.</p>

      <title>Methods</title>
      <sec id="sec2.1">
        <title>Measures being evaluated</title>
        <p>The SF-36 is a generic health status profile measure consisting of eight dimensions of general health (GH); bodily pain (BP); physical functioning (PF); role-physical (RP), mental health (MH); vitality (V); social functioning (SF), and role-emotional (RE). These eight dimensions also can be used to generate a physical and mental health summary scores <xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>. The SF-12 <xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref> is a shortened version of the SF-36, containing 12 of the SF-36 items, and also produces two weighted summary scores (PCS and MCS).</p>
        <p>The EQ-5D valuation questionnaire comprises a five-dimensional questionnaire and an EQ-5D visual analogue scale (VAS). Respondents are asked to provide a position on the EQ-5D health state classification and to report their level of problems (no problems, some/moderate problems or severe/extreme problem) on the questionnaire, which includes mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain, and anxiety/depression. Responses can be converted into one of 243 different health state descriptions (ranging from no problems on any of the dimensions [11111] to severe problems on all five dimensions [33333]) and each one has its own preference-based score. Preference-based scores are determined by eliciting preferences: establishing which health states are preferred from a population sample. In order to do so, a method such as time trade off is used and involves asking participants to consider the relative amounts of time (for example, number of life-years) they would be willing to sacrifice to avoid a certain poorer health state <xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>. Utility values from the UK EQ-5D can range from –0.59 to 1, where negative values are felt to be worse than death and a value of 1 indicates perfect health. The EQ-5D VAS reports on the respondent's self-rated valuation of his or her health stated; thus, it is based on the preferences of the patient, but is not preference based and not normally used to generate QALYs.</p>
        <p>The SF-6D is a preference-based measure of health that can be generated from items of the SF-36 or SF-12 <xref rid="bib3 bib13" ref-type="bibr">[3,13]</xref>. The SF-6D has a classification that describes health on six multilevel dimensions of physical functioning, role limitations, social functioning, pain, mental health, and vitality. There are algorithms for scoring each state based on values obtained from general population surveys using standard gamble (respondents make a series of choices which allow estimation of the strength of preferences regarding a health state). Health state utility values range from 0.29 to 1.0. These health state utility values can be used to calculate QALYs for cost-effectiveness analysis.</p>

        <title>Inclusion and exclusion criteria</title>
        <p>Studies were eligible for inclusion if they contained HRQL data using one or more of the following instruments: SF-36, SF-12, SF-6D, or EQ-5D within the specified population: adults (≥18 years old) with schizophrenia or schizophrenia-related disorders (e.g., schizophreniform disorder or schizoaffective disorder). HRQL data could be from descriptive systems (i.e., their items and dimensions), health state utility values generated by the EQ-5D or SF-6D, or the EQ-5D VAS. Studies with the primary focus on individuals with alcohol and/or drug dependency with comorbid schizophrenia or schizophrenia-related disorder were excluded. The outcomes had to include data that allowed measurement of the construct validity (i.e., known groups or convergent) or the responsiveness of the HRQL instrument(s). Responsiveness data had to be in the form of effect sizes, standardized response means (SRMs), or correlation with change scores on symptom measures. Studies that only provided data on other psychometric properties such as reliability, face validity, and content validity were not included.</p>
      </sec>
      <sec id="sec2.3">
        <title>Identification of studies</title>
        <p>As part of a wider review of HRQL measures in mental health funded by the Medical Research Council (MRC), this review focused on the construct validity and responsiveness of the four generic HRQL measures within schizophrenia. Other reviews were carried out, each focusing on one mental health condition, as part of the wider review. A literature search was performed to identify relevant research for all mental health conditions being investigated within the wider review using database thesaurus and free text terms. Two sets of search terms were combined: terms for each of the four HRQL measures AND terms for the each mental health condition (search strategies are available from authors). Ten databases were searched for published research from inception: Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, NHS Economics and Evaluations Database, Health Technology Database, Database of Abstracts of Reviews of Effects, MEDLINE, PreMEDLINE, CINAHL, EMBASE, and Web of Science. Searches were limited to English language only, but not by date restriction. All searches were conducted in August 2009. The reference lists of relevant studies were searched for further articles.</p>
        <p>Citations identified by the searching process were screened by one reviewer (DP) using the inclusion criteria. The full texts of articles were retrieved for any titles or abstracts that appeared to satisfy the inclusion criteria, or for which inclusion or exclusion could not be definitely determined. The same inclusion and exclusion criteria were used to assess full articles and any queries over inclusion were resolved by discussion and consensus between two reviewers (DP/JB).</p>
      </sec>
      <sec id="sec2.4">
        <title>Data extraction</title>
        <p>Data from all included trials were extracted using a form designed specifically for this review, and piloted on one paper <xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>. Data extracted included: country of publication, type of disorder, study sample characteristics (numbers, age, gender), other measures used, mean scores on HRQL measures, type and method of validity assessment, type and method of responsiveness assessment, and validity and responsiveness data. Extractions were performed by one reviewer (DP). Where duplicate publications reported on similar data, the most complete and recent data were extracted.</p>
      </sec>
      <sec id="sec2.5">
        <title>Quality assessment</title>
        <p>There is no formal method for assessing the quality of these studies (i.e., there are no quality assessment checklists). The methods described by Fitzsimmons et al. <xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref> were used to evaluate HRQL data in their systematic review on the use and validation of HRQL instruments within older cancer patients. This included whether tests of statistical significance were applied, differences between treatment groups were reported (where applicable, e.g., in known groups validity), clinical significance discussed, and missing data were documented. We also report on response and completion rates where these are provided.</p>
      </sec>
      <sec id="sec2.6">
        <title>Evidence synthesis and meta-analysis</title>
        <p>Due to the large degree of heterogeneity between studies (including types of study designs, HRQL instruments, population characteristics and methods of determining construct validity, and responsiveness), it was not appropriate to perform meta-analysis. Analysis was by narrative synthesis and data were tabulated. All analyses were performed based on the HRQL instrument, with data analysis grouped by type of validity (convergent/discriminant or known groups) or responsiveness measured.</p>

        <title>Defining validity and responsiveness</title>
        <sec id="sec2.7.1">
          <title>Validity</title>
          <p>Construct validity is defined as the extent to which an instrument measures the construct it is designed to measure and in the settings it is designed for <xref rid="bib15 bib16" ref-type="bibr">[15,16]</xref>. Construct validity can be measured by known or extreme groups where in theory, in two groups who differ in a trait or behavior, one group is expected to score significantly higher or lower compared with the other group <xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>. Care must be taken to ensure that the groups are hypothesized to have different scores and for preference-based measures care must be taken to ensure that patients and the general public would have clear preferences for one over the other <xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>. Convergent validity assesses the relationship of the instrument of interest to other measures of the same construct to which it should be related <xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>. Convergent validity is the correlation between two measures that in theory are associated. Again, the instrument being used to test convergence of EQ-5D and SF-6D must be a good indicator of the trait or behavior, such as another preference-based measure may be hypothesized to be likely to have a strong relationship to preferences. The strength of correlation between the two instruments was calculated using statistical tests (Pearson's product moment correlation or Spearman's rank correlation). We have used the following categories for evidence of correlation: &gt;0.6, very strong; ≥0.5 to &lt;0.6, strong; &lt;0.5 to ≥ 0.3, moderate; and &lt;0.3, weak. Statistical significance was also attached to correlations (<italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.05).</p>
        </sec>
        <sec id="sec2.7.2">
          <title>Responsiveness</title>
          <p>Walters <xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref> defined responsiveness as the extent to which an instrument can detect a clinically significant or practically important change over time. Any change must be perceptible and important to patients, and something that would be valued by the general public. Responsiveness can be measured in a number of ways by effect size statistics <xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref> standardized in different ways, such as dividing through by the SD at baseline or SD of the change in scores over time (i.e., standardized response means). Within this review, Cohen's <xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref> categories for magnitude of effect size were used: ≥ 0.80, large; &lt;0.80 and ≥ 0.50, moderate; and 0.30 to &lt;0.50, small.</p>
          <p>The application of these psychometric criteria to preference-based measures requires some adaptation <xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>.The purpose of EQ-5D or SF-6D is to identify all differences or changes in health that are important to patients and valued by the general public. An item of the EQ-5D, for example, may fail to pick up small differences in one condition-specific dimension or miss another health dimension entirely, but if these are not important to patients and not valued by the general population, then it is not a weakness of the instrument. Equally, the EQ-5D may fail to reflect clinical differences, but these may not be important to patients. Thus, the tests of construct and convergent validity and responsiveness need to be applied with care.</p>

        <p>The search for studies for the wider review retrieved 4115 unique citations (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>). Of these, 3849 were excluded at the title and abstract stage and 266 full articles were examined. Another 12 studies were identified through reference list checking. Thirty-three studies were identified that provided data on the validity and/or responsiveness of the EQ-5D, SF-36, SF-12, or SF-6D (<xref rid="tbl1 tbl2 tbl3" ref-type="table">Tables 1–3</xref> and <xref rid="sec7" ref-type="sec">Appendix</xref> found at <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.1016/j.jval.2011.04.006">doi:10.1016/j.jval.2011.04.006</ext-link>) within individuals diagnosed with schizophrenia, schizophreniform disorder, or schizoaffective disorder. Six studies were undertaken internationally across more than one country <xref rid="bib8 bib19 bib20 bib21 bib22 bib23" ref-type="bibr">[8,19–23]</xref>; six studies were undertaken in the USA <xref rid="bib24 bib25 bib26 bib27 bib28 bib29" ref-type="bibr">[24–29]</xref>; three in Germany <xref rid="bib30 bib31 bib32" ref-type="bibr">[30–32]</xref>; two in Ethiopia <xref rid="bib33 bib34" ref-type="bibr">[33,34]</xref>; two in France <xref rid="bib35 bib36" ref-type="bibr">[35,36]</xref>; two in Spain <xref rid="bib37 bib38" ref-type="bibr">[37,38]</xref>; two in the Netherlands <xref rid="bib39 bib40" ref-type="bibr">[39,40]</xref>; and two in the United Kingdom <xref rid="bib41 bib42" ref-type="bibr">[41,42]</xref>. The remaining six studies took place in Australia <xref rid="bib43" ref-type="bibr">[43]</xref>, Canada <xref rid="bib44" ref-type="bibr">[44]</xref>, Denmark <xref rid="bib45" ref-type="bibr">[45]</xref>, Hong Kong <xref rid="bib46" ref-type="bibr">[46]</xref>, Italy <xref rid="bib47" ref-type="bibr">[47]</xref>, and Poland <xref rid="bib48" ref-type="bibr">[48]</xref>. Two studies did not report the country in which the study was undertaken <xref rid="bib49 bib50" ref-type="bibr">[49,50]</xref>.</p>
        <p>The number of participants in the studies with schizophrenia or related conditions ranged from 15 to 2657. Participants included both genders and the proportions are reported in <xref rid="tbl1 tbl2" ref-type="table">Tables 1, 2</xref>, and <xref rid="sec7" ref-type="sec">Appendix</xref> found at <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.1016/j.jval.2011.04.006">doi:10.1016/j.jval.2011.04.006</ext-link>. The mean age of participants with a schizophrenia spectrum disorder, reported in 24 of the 33 studies, ranged between 20.3 and 57.9 years. Three studies provided an age range of participants, but not a mean age <xref rid="bib19 bib29 bib39" ref-type="bibr">[19,29,39]</xref>. Six studies did not provide information on age <xref rid="bib21 bib33 bib37 bib43 bib44 bib49" ref-type="bibr">[21,33,37,43,44,49]</xref>.</p>
        <p>All studies obtained HRQL information from patients: seven studies compared patient HRQL values with published general population “normative” values <xref rid="bib22 bib23 bib25 bib28 bib33 bib34 bib45" ref-type="bibr">[22,23,25,28,33,34,45]</xref>; three compared HRQL values with normal comparison participants that were recruited to the study <xref rid="bib24 bib29 bib32" ref-type="bibr">[24,29,32]</xref>; and two used “norms” from healthy participants who had taken part in large surveys <xref rid="bib43 bib46" ref-type="bibr">[43,46]</xref>.</p>
      </sec>
      <sec id="sec3.2">
        <title>Quality of included studies</title>
        <p>Quality assessment of the studies was restricted to items relating to the quality of HRQL reporting and methods used in HRQL data analysis as previously described (<xref rid="tbl4" ref-type="table">Table 4</xref>). All but four studies reported tests for statistical significance of the properties measured <xref rid="bib33 bib43 bib45 bib49" ref-type="bibr">[33,43,45,49]</xref>. Twelve of the 20 studies where it was applicable reported that tests were undertaken for difference between groups (e.g., known groups validity, responsiveness). Nine of the 33 studies considered what constituted a clinically significant difference in HRQL scores (<xref rid="tbl4" ref-type="table">Table 4</xref>), either by providing a predefined value or discussing whether the results were clinically meaningful. However, there was no discussion or inclusion of clinical significance defined in terms of patient perception; thus, from the perspective of preference-based measures, the lack of patient preference undermines the concept of clinical significance. Only three studies fully reported missing HRQL data and four studies partly reported this information. This has implications for the representativeness of these samples due to possible selection bias.</p>

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>Thirty-three studies were identified that examined the validity and/or responsiveness of four generic HRQL measures, although very limited data were found for the generic health status measure SF-12 and the preference-based SF-6D. The studies were undertaken in a variety of countries, mostly in Europe and North America, illustrating the wide use of such measures internationally.</p>
      <p>The majority of the evidence (25 studies) examined the validity and responsiveness of the SF-36. Although there appears to be strong evidence that the SF-36 is able to distinguish between general population norms and scores of people with schizophrenia (known groups validity), the evidence for convergent validity and responsiveness is less certain. Similar findings existed for the EQ-5D, with mixed evidence for the properties of convergent validity and responsiveness. Indeed, when strong associations were found between individual EQ-5D health state dimensions (e.g., anxiety/depression or self-care) and symptom or functioning measures, this did not necessarily translate into comparable changes in overall EQ-5D index scores such as utility values <xref rid="bib30 bib40" ref-type="bibr">[30,40]</xref>. For psychiatric research, it may be that the physical health domains are overly stressed and with less emphasis on mental health, the total EQ-5D index scores may not be accurately represented <xref rid="bib40" ref-type="bibr">[40]</xref>.</p>
      <p>There was some evidence that associations with measures of depression were comparatively stronger than those with symptom measures of schizophrenia (e.g., PANSS) <xref rid="bib23 bib30 bib36 bib41" ref-type="bibr">[23,30,36,41]</xref>. This may indicate that the generic HRQL measures were only able to detect this component of HRQL or that depression is the only component of HRQL within schizophrenia that is important within the context of HRQL measurement. The issue is whether schizophrenia has quality-of-life implications not adequately described by the five dimensions of the EQ-5D.This is an important issue that needs to be explored further using a range of research methods, including qualitative interviews with patients.</p>
      <sec id="sec4.1">
        <title>Types of measures</title>
        <p>When testing association between measures for convergent validity (or change scores in responsiveness), there are good reasons to predict that stronger and more consistent correlations might exist between generic HRQL measures and functioning (e.g., GAF, SOFAS) or mental health/schizophrenia-specific HRQL (e.g., QLS) measures than purely symptom-based measures such as the PANSS. These types of measures are more likely to measure similar concepts to that of generic HRQL measures and due to this degree of overlap, we could reasonably assume that these measures would correlate well with generic HRQL measures. By their very nature, symptom measures are measuring different concepts to HRQL measures, so it might be reasonable to predict that it is less likely that a strong correlation might exist. Similarly, one might expect a greater degree of association between subjective measures (completed by patients) and generic HRQL measures than with objective symptom measures (typically completed by clinicians).</p>
        <p>Re-examining the evidence accounting for the type of measure used to assess convergent validity (symptom vs. functioning or HRQL measures; subjective vs. objective measures), for whichever the type of measure the evidence for convergent validity remains uncertain in this population. Ten studies suggested no or uncertain evidence for a correlation between symptom measures and generic HRQL measures <xref rid="bib8 bib20 bib23 bib32 bib36 bib41 bib46 bib47 bib48" ref-type="bibr">[8,20,23,32,36,41,46–48]</xref> whereas four revealed moderate to strong correlations <xref rid="bib28 bib30 bib41 bib44" ref-type="bibr">[28,30,41,44]</xref>. Functioning and schizophrenia HRQL measures did not fare much better, with four studies indicating strong evidence for convergent validity <xref rid="bib35 bib38 bib42 bib44" ref-type="bibr">[35,38,42,44]</xref> and four describing uncertain or no evidence of such a relationship <xref rid="bib21 bib36 bib39 bib41" ref-type="bibr">[21,36,39,41]</xref>. Of the seven studies that used objective measures to test an association, four reported a strong evidence for convergent validity <xref rid="bib35 bib37 bib42 bib46" ref-type="bibr">[35,37,42,46]</xref> and three found no such evidence <xref rid="bib30 bib31 bib41" ref-type="bibr">[30,31,41]</xref>.</p>
        <p>Thus, it seems there is a wider issue regarding what types of measures might reasonably be expected to correlate strongly with generic HRQL measures. It is difficult to determine how strongly correlated in theory generic HRQL measures should be with symptom and/or other measures and there is little guidance on what constitutes reasonable correlation. Indeed, Walters <xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref> noted that some would say it is impossible to <italic>prove</italic> validity of HRQL instruments because no “gold standard” exists. Although a number of different concepts or constructs will be the same or similar between HRQL and other measures, there will of course be some areas where there is no overlap. Also, as discussed previously, where health dimensions and changes appear to have been missed by preference-based HRQL measures, these may not actually be important to patients or valued by the general population; thus it cannot be determined as a weakness of the measure. This needs to be explored in further research.</p>

        <title>Strengths and limitations</title>
        <p>This review comprehensively identified studies that reported on the construct validity and responsiveness of four generic HRQL measures (SF-6D, SF-12, SF-36, and EQ-5D), and then tabulated and provided a narrative synthesis of the findings. The review has some limitations, mainly due to compromising on some elements of the review process due to the large scope of the project. The search for studies was reasonably comprehensive, but it was limited to key databases and reference list checking of included studies, and study selection was undertaken by one reviewer. Ideally, further searching could be undertaken in trial registries, conference proceedings, and by citation searching to make the search process fully comprehensive. Study quality assessment has been pragmatic and focused on the elements that contribute to HRQL analysis. The populations included in this review were heterogeneous in terms of the nature of schizophrenia (e.g., clinical form, evolution form, medication), but not all studies provided detailed or uniform information on these characteristics. Such clinical variables clearly have an impact on HRQL and these factors will have had an impact upon the results of individual studies. Nevertheless, this review gives an overall picture of the validity and responsiveness of these four measures in this population and provides a starting point for future more focused reviews and future primary research.</p>

      <sec id="sec4.3">
        <title>Further research</title>
        <p>There is very limited evidence of validity or responsiveness for the SF-12 and SF-6D and, though they are derivatives of the SF-36, they have a limited item coverage (12 and 11, respectively) and may not perform as well. Therefore, further research needs to be directed toward demonstrating these properties for these instruments.</p>
        <p>Research also needs to be directed toward developing robust methods of demonstrating validity and responsiveness for generic HRQL measures. For known groups validity, the evidence discriminating between healthy and not healthy individuals could be considered fairly crude; large differences should be obviously apparent between such groups. Therefore, research is required to demonstrate an instrument that can reflect these differences between different severities of the disorder. For convergent validity, this might mean consideration of which measures to choose for assessment of strength of correlation, both by considering the type of measure (e.g., symptom functioning or HRQL) and the nature of measure (subjective or objective). Studies need to be explicit at their outset about the hypothesized associations when investigating validity and responsiveness. In addition, wherever studies can investigate feasibility of generic HRQL measures alongside construct validity and responsiveness within this disease area, this will allow a greater overall understanding of which measures are useful within schizophrenia.</p>
        <p>This review was limited to examining quantitative evidence, but researchers and regulatory authorities, such as the Food and Drug Administration and the European Medicines Agency, also require qualitative evidence on the validity of measures in specific patient groups based on interviews with patients <xref rid="bib51 bib52" ref-type="bibr">[51,52]</xref>. Some of the questions raised in this review might be better addressed through the use of qualitative interviews with patients who will provide greater insight into the shortcomings of these generic measures. Whereas qualitative research indicates generic measures, such as the EQ-5D and SF-6D, are not suitable within schizophrenia, alternative HRQL measures need to be found. One alternative is to develop a preference-based mental health index based on either an existing measure or the development of a new one <xref rid="bib53" ref-type="bibr">[53]</xref>. Another alternative would be to develop “add-on” dimensions that reflect the concerns of patients with mental health conditions like schizophrenia.</p>

      <title>Conclusion</title>
      <p>In conclusion, the evidence found in this review on the validity and responsiveness for a number of widely used generic measures in patients with schizophrenia has been mixed. Although the evidence base is limited in a number of important respects (including problems with the measures used to develop constructs in the validation studies), it is sufficient to raise doubts about the use of generic measures of health like the EQ-5D and SF-36 in patients with schizophrenia. This suggests that agencies, such as NICE, which advise on reimbursement of health costs, should be willing to consider evidence on health state utility values based on other methods.</p>
