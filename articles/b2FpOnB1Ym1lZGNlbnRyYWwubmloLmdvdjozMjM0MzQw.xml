          <p>Microparticles of iron oxide (MPIO; 1 and 4.5 μm diameter) in suspension were visualized and accurately quantified using a clinical optical coherence tomography system.

We then compared the retention of antibody-conjugated MPIO targeting each of these molecules plus a combined VCAM-1 and E-selectin (E + V) probe across a range of physiologically relevant shear stresses. E + V MPIO were consistently retained with highest efficiency (<italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.001) and at a density that provided conspicuous contrast effects on OCT pullback.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>Optical coherence tomography (OCT) is a high-resolution optical imaging technique with a range of applications in biology and medicine. Using a wire-mounted endovascular near-infrared probe, the walls of coronary arteries can be imaged with high resolution (∼10 μm), though with relatively limited depth penetrance. Consequently, OCT is used to evaluate superficial atherosclerotic plaque morphology <xref rid="bib0005" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>, including macrophage accumulation <xref rid="bib0010" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>. The utility of OCT might be further enhanced by the availability of molecular imaging contrast agents directed towards targets that are differentially expressed in pathological states by the vascular endothelium. Successful molecular imaging approaches have used reporter particles that include ligand-conjugated microbubbles <xref rid="bib0015" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>, micelles <xref rid="bib0020" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>, liposomes <xref rid="bib0025" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref> and iron oxide-containing micro- <xref rid="bib0030" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref> or nanoparticles <xref rid="bib0035" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>. Effective contrast agents for OCT enhance light scattering, for instance through the use of gold- <xref rid="bib0040 bib0045" ref-type="bibr">[8,9]</xref> or titanium dioxide nanoparticles <xref rid="bib0050" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>. Microparticles of iron oxide (MPIO) also exert a light scattering effect <xref rid="bib0055" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>, though they have not been tested as a monolayer that would be required for vascular molecular imaging.</p>
      <p>Molecules upregulated in vascular inflammation (such as VCAM-1 <xref rid="bib0060" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref> and E-selectin <xref rid="bib0065" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>) mediate leukocyte adhesion to activated endothelium and provide an attractive target for imaging and drug delivery. Their prominent position on the luminal surface of endothelial cells allows ready access to circulating ligand−particle complexes. Such markers have been targeted most commonly with antibodies, although peptide−protein recognition and carbohydrate−protein binding provide alternative strategies <xref rid="bib0070 bib0075" ref-type="bibr">[14,15]</xref>. However, a major challenge is the delivery of a targeted particulate contrast agent to the endothelial surface in sufficient quantities under conditions of high shear stress to permit its identification. Critical to the rational design of such contrast agents is knowledge of (1) the abundance of these targets, (2) the extent to which their surface expression varies between basal and activated states, and (3) the ability of contrast particles to bind under conditions of flow.</p>
      <p>Here, we investigate the potency of MPIO targeted to human PECAM-1, VCAM-1 or E-selectin or a combination of VCAM-1 and E-selectin to bind to stimulated human endothelial cells under a range of shear stress conditions. Using these findings, we then applied a catheter-mounted clinical OCT system to visualize and quantify MPIO binding to activated endothelial cells <italic>in vitro</italic> under physiologically relevant conditions of shear stress to demonstrate the possibility of OCT for molecular imaging of vascular inflammation.</p>

        <title>Antibody–MPIO binding experiments under static and shear stress conditions</title>
        <p>HUVEC were stimulated with TNF-α for 8 h, fixed with 4% formaldehyde, washed with PBS and stored at 4 °C. For static binding experiments, antibody–MPIO (10 μg mL<sup>−1</sup> antibody; ∼2.5 × 10<sup>8</sup> MPIO mL<sup>−1</sup>) was added to cells and placed on a bench-top rocker prior to thorough washing with PBS. Binding under shear stress was performed by mounting culture dishes on a Parallel-Plate flow chamber (GlycoTech, Gaithersburg, USA) fitted with gasket B (0.25 cm × 0.025 cm) and connected to a syringe infusion pump (Pump 22; Harvard Apparatus, Cambridge, USA).</p>
        <p>Flow rates to generate the required shear stress conditions were calculated using the following formula <italic>τ</italic> = <italic>6Qμ</italic>/<italic>bh</italic><sup>2</sup>, whereby <italic>τ</italic> = shear stress (dyne cm<sup>−2</sup>), <italic>Q</italic> = flow rate (mL s<sup>−1</sup>), <italic>μ</italic> = viscosity of liquid (in poise (P); dH<sub>2</sub>O = 0.0076 P), <italic>b</italic> = channel width (cm) and <italic>h</italic> = channel height (cm). To simulate a range of physiological shear stress conditions that are found in the circulatory system, flow chamber experiments were conducted at 1, 5, 10 and 15 dyne cm<sup>−2</sup>. MPIO binding after 5 min of shear stress was assessed in 20 random fields of view in 4 separate experiments using a 40×, 0.6 NA objective fitted to the Olympus IX-71 microscope described above. Clumps of MPIO were counted as a single binding event.</p>

        <title>Assessment of MPIO binding in <italic>ex vivo</italic> coronary arterioles</title>
        <p><italic>Ex vivo</italic>, cannulated and pressurized coronary arterioles were studied with bright field and fluorescence videomicroscopy, as described previously <xref rid="bib0090 bib0095" ref-type="bibr">[18,19]</xref>. Briefly, with the use of microsurgical instruments and an operating microscope, the second branch of septal coronary arteriole (internal diameter 125–150 μm and ∼1.5 mm in length) was isolated from the heart of male Wistar rats (<italic>N</italic> = 4) and transferred to organ chambers containing two glass micropipettes filled with MOPS (pH 7.4). The vessels were cannulated at both ends, and the micropipettes were connected with silicone tubing to hydrostatic pressure reservoirs to set the intraluminal pressure to 70 mmHg. The temperature was set at 37 °C by a circulating bath temperature controller (Grant Instruments, Cambridge, UK).</p>
        <p>VCAM-1 MPIO were prepared as described above and administered intraluminally to the coronary arteriole at constant flow rate of 25 μL min<sup>−1</sup>. Intraluminal flow was generated by changing the inflow and outflow pressures in opposite direction, while flow rate was measured with a ball-type flow meter (Omega, Stamford, USA). The arteriolar diameter was continuously recorded and wall shear stress was calculated, as described earlier <xref rid="bib0100" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>.</p>
        <p>MPIOs were visualized with whole-field fluorescence measurements by using a ultra fast filter switching-based imaging system (Oligochrome, TILL Photonics, Uckfield, UK) on a Nikon Eclipse FN1 microscope (Nikon, Kingston-upon-Thames, UK) equipped with a 20× water dipping objective (NA 0.5) and illuminated with 475/35 nm light. Fluorescent images were acquired with an Andor Luca (S) cooled EM CCD camera (Andor, Belfast, Northern Ireland) at 10 Hz. Images were analysed off-line using Arivis Browser (TILL Photonics). Small regions of interest (1000 μm<sup>2</sup>) were selected over the surface of endothelial layer and MPIOs were counted manually. The number of bound MPIO were averaged in these regions and presented as binding events per 1000 μm<sup>2</sup>.</p>
        <p>Following basal flow experiments, <italic>ex vivo</italic> coronary arterioles were stimulated with TNF-α (7.25 nmol L<sup>−1</sup>, for 4 h) and MPIO binding events were recorded after stimulation.</p>

        <p>For monolayer experiments, PECAM-1–MPIO (1 μm) were added to a dish of fixed HUVEC and incubated under static conditions described above. A 20-gauge venous cannula (BD Biosciences) provided a track for the OCT catheter immediately above the cell monolayer. E + V–MPIO were run through the flow chamber at shear stresses of 1 and 5 dyne cm<sup>−2</sup>.</p>
        <p>OCT was performed using a C7 Dragonfly Catheter connected to a C7-XR OCT Intravascular Imaging System (LightLab, St Paul, USA). A 15 mm pullback (0.5 mm s<sup>−1</sup>) was used to image bound antibody–MPIO. The signal or contrast generated by the MPIO was measured by thresholding the images to a pixel intensity 2 standard deviations above the background, and then measuring the area of signal above threshold using ImageJ (NIH, Bethesda, USA).</p>

        <p>MPIO dispersed in suspension produced a light scattering effect represented as discreet regions of bright signal in the OCT image. Larger MPIO resulted in brighter and more distinct signal, with the 4.5 μm particles conspicuous as punctuate spots. The 1 μm MPIO were clearly detectable above background, though in a more diffuse pattern (<xref rid="fig0020" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>).</p>
        <p>OCT was next applied to image MPIO in a single plane on a monolayer of endothelial cells, rather than suspended in a volume. PECAM-1-targeted 1 μm MPIO were allowed to bind under static conditions to a monolayer of HUVEC, which constitutively express PECAM-1, represented in <xref rid="fig0025" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>A. Bound MPIO appeared as an intensely bright band along the cell surface (<xref rid="fig0025" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>B), with homogeneous low signal in the ‘no-MPIO’ control (<xref rid="fig0025" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>C). The signal intensity profile of a line drawn across the monolayer (<xref rid="fig0025" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>D) shows clear demarcation of MPIO from adjacent cells/agarose. This marked contrast effect was consistent along a 10 mm automated pullback and a significant difference in the mean pixel intensity was observed between PECAM-1–MPIO and no MPIO controls (<xref rid="fig0025" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>E).</p>

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>Optical coherence tomography provides high-resolution anatomical images of coronary arteries and associated pathology. Here, we designed and evaluated <italic>in vitro</italic> a new molecular OCT imaging agent targeting molecules that are differentially expressed by activated endothelial cells. Light-scattering particles of iron oxide provided conspicuous contrast when bound to the activated endothelium under conditions of shear stress that were designed to mimic <italic>in vivo</italic> binding.</p>
      <p>To date, a range of particles have been used to enhance signal for OCT. Gold nanoparticles demonstrate a light scattering effect <xref rid="bib0045" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref> and immuno-targeting has allowed them to be used in live cell studies <xref rid="bib0105" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>. Particles of iron oxide have excellent light scattering properties <xref rid="bib0055" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>. Furthermore, the surfaces of such particles can be functionalised to allow loading with specific ligands targeting vascular endothelium <xref rid="bib0080" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>. As expected, the light scattering and therefore contrast effects of larger particles were greater, but even 1 μm MPIO were readily identifiable with OCT. However, given the known tendency for ≥4.5 μm particles to be retained by the lungs after intra-venous injection <xref rid="bib0080" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>, we elected to evaluate the smaller (1 μm) MPIO in subsequent experiments.</p>
      <p>A number of imaging and therapeutic approaches have successfully targeted adhesion molecules that are involved in the recruitment of circulating leukocytes to sites of local inflammation <xref rid="bib0015 bib0030 bib0110" ref-type="bibr">[3,6,22]</xref>. While the roles of adhesion molecules in cellular recruitment have been partially defined <xref rid="bib0075" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>, their relative abilities to mediate binding of antibody-conjugated inert particles is unexplored. To fully capitalise on these properties, requires appreciation of (a) the density of the target and (b) the extent to which its expression changes between basal and activated states and (c) the relative affinities of ligand and ligand combinations for these targets, including under conditions of shear stress.</p>
      <p>While PECAM-1 was the most abundant target molecule, this study confirmed its constitutive expression and lack of regulation in response to a pro-inflammatory stimulus. In contrast, both E-selectin and VCAM-1 were markedly up-regulated from undetectable levels, and therefore more suitable as targets for distinguishing pathological states. The design of a contrast agent should take into consideration the abundance and location of the target. Based on our findings, targets at a low abundance may only be detectable by particles at relatively low shear stress, while higher abundance targets may be detected across a broader range of shear stress conditions.</p>
      <p>The dynamics of leukocyte–endothelial binding are complex and dependent on multiple receptor–ligand interactions. Initial leukocyte rolling is selectin-mediated while firm adhesion is mediated by integrin binding to ICAM-1 and VCAM-1, with the latter more important in initiation of atherosclerosis. ‘Adhesion dynamic modelling’ predicts synergistic roles for selectins and integrins with transition between rolling and firm adhesion dependent on binding affinities and relative concentrations of receptor–ligand interactions <xref rid="bib0115 bib0120" ref-type="bibr">[23,24]</xref>. Taking this into consideration, we have previously adopted a dual antibody-conjugated MPIO approach for targeted MRI and applied this to the detection of adhesion molecules on the arterial endothelium of apolipoprotein E knockout (apoE<sup>−/−</sup>) mice <italic>in vivo</italic> <xref rid="bib0080" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>. The current <italic>in vitro</italic> data corroborate this: the E-selectin and VCAM-1 antibodies on the dual labelled MPIO combined synergistically to enhance particle binding across a wide range of shear stress conditions compared with the constituent single-targeted particles. Our dual-labelled E + V MPIO bound in sufficient numbers to allow detection with OCT enabling distinction of activated and basal endothelium under shear stress conditions that are representative of venous to arterial blood flow.</p>
      <p>We corroborated our <italic>in vitro</italic> findings with an <italic>ex vivo</italic> experiment using rat coronary arterioles as a model of inflammation. Using fluorescently labelled VCAM-1–MPIO, we demonstrated the capacity of targeted MPIO to differentiate between inflamed and basal endothelium under conditions of shear stress.</p>
      <p>We developed a cell-based <italic>in vitro</italic> model because of the ability to isolate and control variables influencing antibody–MPIO binding. We have previously reported binding of MPIO in mouse atherosclerosis, acute brain inflammation and in brain and renal ischemia–reperfusion injury, and the ability of MPIO to bind under conditions of flow, <italic>in vivo</italic>, is established <xref rid="bib0030 bib0080" ref-type="bibr">[6,16]</xref>. <italic>In vivo</italic>, however, multiple variables may contribute to differential binding of MPIO, including: (1) ligand–target pairing; (2) target density; (3) shear forces; (4) specific anatomy. The purpose of the current approach was to vary (a) shear and (b) ligand–target pairing in a controlled fashion and to evaluate the contributions of each, thereby aiding rational contrast agent design. HUVEC were selected as they are a well-characterised model of inflammation <xref rid="bib0125 bib0130" ref-type="bibr">[25,26]</xref> that have been previously used in leukocyte adhesion assays <xref rid="bib0135 bib0140" ref-type="bibr">[27,28]</xref>.</p>

        <title>Limitations</title>
        <p>This study and others have employed antibodies as targeting ligands. While antibodies can provide both high affinity and specificity, they are not the endogenous ligands for either integrins or selectins and our findings cannot be extrapolated to the binding of leukocytes <italic>in vivo</italic>. Nor can the results, with the specific antibodies used in this study, be generalised to all antibodies-target interactions, since variation in epitope and affinity may affect binding properties. Furthermore, antibodies are expensive to produce, and are capable of inducing an immune response in the host, so “humanisation” of animal antibodies would be required for safe use of such MPIO in humans. For these reasons alternative targeting strategies are under development. Recently, synthetic sialyl Lewis<sup>x</sup>, a carbohydrate found on the surface of most leukocyte populations, has been used to target glyconanoparticles to E- and P-selectin in brain inflammation and a VCAM-1 specific peptide, generated by phage display <xref rid="bib0145 bib0150" ref-type="bibr">[29,30]</xref> has also been successfully used as a targeting molecule to image inflammatory atherosclerosis.</p>

        <title>Imaging of MPIO endothelial targeted MPIO using OCT</title>
        <p>MPIO bound to activated endothelium under conditions of shear stress were clearly identified. The <italic>in vitro</italic> system comprising of the monolayer of cells and agarose provided minimal background scattering with OCT and so despite the MPIO signal variability, a clear and statistically significant demarcation could be made between the presence or absence of bound MPIO, reflective of the inflamed or basal states. The <italic>in vivo</italic> environment and presence of different tissues, however, may produce more scattering, although unlabelled gold-coated protein microspheres been visualized via OCT in murine liver with minimal scatter from the native vasculature.</p>
        <p>Should background scatter prove problematic, developments or refinements to the OCT protocol may improve the signal or contrast effect of imaging particles. For instance, differential phase-OCT has been described, whereby magnetic microparticles were excited by the application of an oscillating magnetic flux density and the improved contrast effect used to image macrophage infiltration in atherosclerotic plaque <xref rid="bib0155" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref> and this technique would be directly applicable when targeted MPIO are used. Larger diameter microparticles provide enhanced scattering effects over smaller particles, but they may be undesirable in other aspects <xref rid="bib0080" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>; smaller particles decorated with optically active elements are also under investigation. In addition to quantification of molecular expression from the use of targeted imaging agent, OCT also provides complementary high-resolution morphological information on vessel and plaque structure <xref rid="bib0005" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>. OCT could be combined with non-invasive MR imaging to provide a hybrid imaging strategy; inflammation and plaque formation could first be identified using MRI, which could then be followed up with OCT at the time of coronary intervention to further characterise the plaque composition and morphology.</p>

      <title>Conclusions</title>
      <p>Microparticles of iron oxide (1 and 4.5 μm) were detectable using a commercially available optical coherence tomography system and imaging probe. Functionalised particles bearing antibodies to a range of endothelial targets were generated. Quantification of targets (E-selectin, VCAM-1 and PECAM-1) in cultured endothelial cells in a basal state and after TNF-α stimulation identified potential targets for molecular imaging. Assessment of binding under flow conditions recommended a combined approach that targeted both E-selectin and VCAM-1, as predicted from earlier <italic>in silico</italic> modelling and <italic>in vivo</italic> binding in mice. Bound under conditions of flow, targeted MPIO were readily identified on OCT pullback. Molecular imaging with OCT may be feasible <italic>in vivo</italic> using antibody targeted MPIO and combined with MR imaging to provide hybrid imaging approaches.</p>

Fold-difference of fluorescence intensity relative to the cells only control was calculated by the Cytobank web-based analysis software and a heatmap generated.

            <p>Antibody-labelling and flow cytometry evaluation of MPIO conjugation. The antibody labelling of MPIO was verified by labelling with an Alexa 488-conjugated anti-mouse secondary antibody and images taken with a monochrome CCD camera. MPIO labelled with antibodies against E-selectin, VCAM-1, a combination of E-selectin and VCAM-1, PECAM-1 and a non-specific IgG<sub>2</sub> control were imaged separately and pseudocoloured red, green, yellow, magenta and cyan, respectively (A). Quantitative flow cytometry was used to evaluate loading efficiency. For all antibodies labelled, approximately 5–10% remained unlabelled, while the labelled MPIO comprised single MPIO and multiples, resulting in multiple peaks (B) (example shown is E-selectin–MPIO). Differential interference contrast images of antibody-labelled MPIO confirm a mixture of single and multiple particles (C).</p>

The PECAM-1–MPIO bound to the cell monolayer are visible as a bright horizontal band in the OCT image (B). ‘No-MPIO’ control experiment confirms background signal is minimal (C). The intensity profile of a line drawn perpendicular to the monolayer with PECAM-1–MPIO bound reveals a clear demarcation between MPIO and surrounding agarose and cells (D). Areas of measurable signal along the pullback are significantly greater for PECAM-1–MPIO compared with the no MPIO control (E) (Error bars represent ±1 SEM).

In stimulated cells under static and low shear stress conditions, antibody–MPIO to E-selectin, VCAM-1 and E + V bind in greater numbers than PECAM-1–MPIO. However, as shear stress increases, PECAM-1–MPIO bind in significantly greater numbers than the other antibody–MPIO (A).

        <p>Representative microphotographs show isolated, pressurized coronary arterioles (internal diameter: 100 μm) of the rat. Left panel shows bright field image of the arteriole, whereas fluorescent (FITC excited) images show VCAM-1–MPIO (arrowheads) adhered to the endothelial cells before (basal, shown in the middle panel) and after stimulation with TNF-α (7.25 nmol L<sup>−1</sup> for 4-h, right panel). VCAM-1–MPIO were delivered intraluminally into the pressurized arteriole at the flow rate of 25 μL min<sup>−1</sup> (A). Mean binding events in isolated coronary arterioles were significantly higher in TNF-α stimulated vessel than in basal tissue (B). Western immunoblots show expression of VCAM-1 and β-actin in coronary arterioles before (basal) and after stimulation with TNF-α (7.25 nmol L<sup>−1</sup> for 4-h).</p>

        <p>OCT imaging of MPIO binding to E-selectin and VCAM-1 under conditions of shear stress. Binding of E + V–MPIO at 1 dyne cm<sup>−2</sup> was detectable using OCT, and the particles bound to the cell monolayer were clearly visible (A). No signal was seen in the basal control at 1 dyne cm<sup>−2</sup> (B). The intensity profile of a line drawn perpendicular to the monolayer with PECAM-1–MPIO bound reveals a clear demarcation between MPIO and surrounding agarose and cells (C). Area of signal generated by the E + V–MPIO binding at 1 dyne cm<sup>−2</sup> in the OCT images is significantly higher in the stimulated cells than in the basal controls (D&amp;E), while the reduction in binding to stimulated cells at 5 dyne cm<sup>−2</sup> results in a lower signal area, but which is still significantly greater than the basal equivalent (E). Error bars represent ±1 SEM.</p>
