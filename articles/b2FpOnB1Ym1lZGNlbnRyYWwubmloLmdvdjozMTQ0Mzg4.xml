      <abstract>
        <p>Myeloperoxidase is abundantly present in inflammatory diseases where activation of monocytes/macrophages and T-cell-mediated immune response occurs. The potent oxidant hypochlorous acid (HOCl), generated by the myeloperoxidase–H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>–chloride system of activated phagocytes, converts low-density lipoprotein (LDL) into a proinflammatory lipoprotein particle. Here, we investigated the apoptotic effect of HOCl–LDL, an <italic>in vivo</italic> occurring LDL modification, on human T-cell lymphoblast-like Jurkat cells. Experiments revealed that HOCl–LDL, depending on the oxidant:lipoprotein molar ratio, induces apoptosis via activation of caspase-3, PARP cleavage and accumulation of reactive oxygen species. The absence of Fas-associated protein with death domain or caspase-8 in mutant cells did not prevent HOCl–LDL induced apoptosis. In contrast, overexpression of the anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 protein protects Jurkat cells against HOCl–LDL-induced apoptosis and prevents accumulation of reactive oxygen species. We conclude that HOCl–LDL-mediated apoptosis in Jurkat cells follows predominantly the intrinsic, mitochondrial pathway. <italic>In</italic><italic>situ</italic> experiments revealed that an antibody raised against HOCl–LDL recognized epitopes that colocalize both with myeloperoxidase and CD3-positive T-cells in human decidual tissue where local stimulation of the immune system occurs. We provide convincing evidence that formation of HOCl-modified (lipo)proteins generated by the myeloperoxidase–H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>–chloride system contributes to apoptosis in T-cells.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>Apoptosis, a type of programmed cell death, is indispensable for cell growth control and immune defence. The extrinsic apoptotic pathway requires the binding of a ligand to a death receptor (Fas/CD95 or TNFR1), which recruits two signal-transducing molecules, e.g. TNFR1-associated death domain and Fas-associated protein with death domain (FADD). Binding of procaspase-8 to this complex results in activation by auto- and transproteolytic cleavage, which then initiates proteolytic cleavage of procaspase-3. Caspase-3 finally executes apoptosis e.g. through cleavage of the nuclear DNA repair enzyme poly(ADP-ribose)polymerase (PARP), induction of DNA fragmentation, chromatin condensation, cell shrinking, membrane blebbing, and formation of apoptotic bodies <xref rid="b0005" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>.</p>
      <p>The intrinsic apoptotic pathway is due to swelling of mitochondria and release of a variety of apoptotic factors that may either directly or indirectly induce apoptosis via cytochrome C-mediated activation of procaspase-9 and subsequent recruitment of procaspase-3. Most importantly, the intrinsic apoptotic pathway is under tight control of members of the Bcl-2 family, which can either promote cell survival (e.g. Bcl-2 protein) or cell death (Bax) <xref rid="b0010" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>.</p>
      <p>Apoptosis is a major component of normal development. However, apoptosis has been also recognized in a number of common and threatening vascular diseases e.g. atherosclerosis <xref rid="b0015" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>, where excessive accumulation of monocytes/macrophages, smooth muscle cells, and T-lymphocytes, and secretion of cytokines and growth factors is believed to be a major cause of disease progression. Most importantly, oxidation of low-density lipoprotein (ox-LDL) has been implicated in the pathogenesis of various inflammatory diseases <xref rid="b0020" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>. For instance, ox-LDL modulates expression of growth factors, adhesion molecules, and tissue factor, stimulates smooth muscle cell proliferation, induces monocyte and T-cell recruitment and activation, and promotes foam cell and fatty streak formation <xref rid="b0020" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>. Although multiple studies have shown that copper–ox-LDL, a convenient experimental model for oxidative LDL modification elicits apoptotic cell death in monocytes/macrophages (for review see: <xref rid="b0025" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>), knowledge about the consequences of ox-LDL on lymphocyte apoptosis is limited <xref rid="b0030 b0035 b0040" ref-type="bibr">[6–8]</xref>. Activated T-lymphocytes are present in human lesions <xref rid="b0045" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref> supporting evidence that T-cell-mediated immunity contributes to the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis and other inflammatory diseases <xref rid="b0015" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>.</p>
      <p>The phagocytic enzyme myeloperoxidase (MPO) is abundantly present in various inflammatory diseases. Once activated MPO generates hypochlorous acid (HOCl) from H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> and physiological chloride concentrations <xref rid="b0050" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>. HOCl, a potent oxidant and bactericidal and viricidal agent, reacts readily with biomolecules e.g. thiols and thioesters, Fe–S centers, nucleotides, unsaturated fatty acids and proteins to form reactive chloramines, which are in turn powerful oxidants. Most importantly, hypochlorite-modified LDL (HOCl–LDL), prone to elicit foam cell formation <italic>in vitro</italic> <xref rid="b0055" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>, is present in human lesion material <xref rid="b0060" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>. Interactions of HOCl–LDL with cells of haematopoietic origin, as well as smooth muscle and endothelial cells (for review see: <xref rid="b0065" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>) and epithelial cells <xref rid="b0070" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref> have been studied and a panel of atherogenic and proinflammatory features have been reported for this <italic>in vivo</italic> occurring oxidative LDL modification <xref rid="b0065" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>.</p>
      <p>The present study aimed at investigating the interaction of HOCl–LDL with T-cells. We were interested whether HOCl–LDL acts as an initiator of the apoptotic machinery in wild-type lymphoblastic Jurkat cells. To reveal whether apoptosis occurs via extrinsic and/or intrinsic routes, Jurkat cell mutants deficient in FADD or caspase-8 or overexpressing Bcl-2 were used. MPO-dependent generation of HOCl-modified proteins has been detected in various inflammatory conditions e.g. atherosclerosis <xref rid="b0075" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>, glomerular and tubulointerstitial injury <xref rid="b0080" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>, and placental tissue <xref rid="b0085" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>, where immune cells are contributing. Thus, a specific aim of the present study was whether an antibody raised against HOCl–LDL might detect HOCl-modified epitopes that colocalize with T-lymphocytes in human tissues.</p>

The samples were rinsed in PBS and incubated (30 min) with Cy-2-labeled goat anti-mouse antibody (dilution of 1:300). Then, the sections were incubated with anti-MPO antiserum, followed by a goat anti-rabbit Cy-5-labeled mAb (dilution 1:300) <xref rid="b0085" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>. For triple labeling, the sections were additionally incubated (20 min) with a PE-labeled anti-human CD3 mAb. All incubation steps were performed in a dark moist chamber at 25 °C.</p>
          <p>The samples were analyzed on a confocal laser scanning microscope in sequential mode (Leica SP2), using the 488 nm laser line for the excitation of Cy-2, the 543 nm line for PE, and the 647 nm line for Cy-5, respectively. Detection settings were: 500 to 535 nm (Cy-2), 555 nm to 620 nm (PE), and 665 nm to 750 nm (Cy-5). Negative controls were performed by replacing the primary antibody by either mouse IgG<sub>1</sub>, rabbit non-immune IgG or mouse IgG<sub>1</sub> labeled with PE.</p>

      <title>Results and discussion</title>
      <p>Oxidative modification of LDL generates a panel of highly reactive, toxic compounds that elicit an inflammatory response and may promote apoptosis <xref rid="b0025" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>. Activation of the extrinsic and intrinsic apoptotic pathways has been studied in cells of mesenchymal origin e.g. monocytes/macrophages, smooth muscle and endothelial cells, and T-lymphocytes. While oxidation of LDL by copper leads to fragmentation of both the protein and the lipid moiety, modification of LDL by HOCl, added as reagent or generated enzymatically by the MPO–H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>–chloride system reacts primarily with Lys/His and the N-terminal α-amino groups giving rise to formation of chloramines <xref rid="b0065" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>.</p>
      <p>Using the TUNEL-assay we show that mAb CH-11 (acting as a Fas ligand), induced pronounced apoptotic fragmentation in wild-type Jurkat cells (<xref rid="f0005" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>A). When cells were treated with HOCl–LDL, fragmentation of nuclear chromatin, a hallmark of late-stage apoptosis, became apparent. <xref rid="f0005" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>A (upper panel) demonstrates that the degree of chromatin fragmentation dose-dependently increases with an increasing oxidant:lipoprotein molar ratio. Also staining of DNA with 7-AAD revealed that treatment of cells with HOCl–LDL (at increasing oxidant:lipoprotein molar ratio) is paralleled by an increasing number of morphologically changed nuclei with either condensed or already fragmented DNA (<xref rid="f0005" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>A, lower panel).</p>
      <p><xref rid="f0005" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>B demonstrates no change of procaspase-8 up to 8 h, while a 24 h treatment with HOCl–LDL led to an impaired immunoreactive procaspase-8 band, indicating a slight involvement of the extrinsic apoptotic pathway in wild-type cells. Next, activation of procaspase-3 as well as PARP-cleavage, two processes that are induced by extrinsic/intrinsic pathways, was followed. Western blot experiments demonstrated that HOCl–LDL led to activation of procaspases-3 (after 8 h) and PARP cleavage in a time-dependent manner starting 4 h after treatment (<xref rid="f0005" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>B).</p>
      <p>In none of the experiments performed, native LDL showed any signs of apoptosis or nuclear fragmentation in Jurkat cells (<xref rid="f0005" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>).</p>
      <p>To get further insights in HOCl–LDL-mediated extrinsic and/or intrinsic- apoptotic pathway, mutant T-cells were used. HOCl–LDL treatment increased the number of propidium iodide-positive Jurkat cells with no significant difference between wild-type, FADD<sup>def</sup> or Casp-8<sup>def</sup> cells (<xref rid="f0010" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>A). However, the number of propidium iodide-positive cells was significantly decreased in Bcl-2 cells. Again, native LDL (<xref rid="f0010" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>A) had no significant effect on formation of propidium iodide-positive cells when compared to untreated cells (data not shown). Incubation of Jurkat cell lines with HOCl–LDL (at increasing oxidant:lipoprotein molar ratios) revealed induced PARP cleavage in wild-type, FADD<sup>def</sup> and Casp-8<sup>def</sup> cells. Although in Bcl-2 cells the 116 kDa full-length PARP tended to decrease, no evidence of the 86 kDa PARP cleavage product became apparent using HOCl–LDL. This set of experiments suggested preferential involvement of the intrinsic pathway in wild-type, FADD<sup>def</sup> and Casp-8<sup>def</sup> cells. Again, native LDL had no impact on PARP cleavage in all the cell lines investigated (<xref rid="f0010" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>B).</p>
      <p>Next, we assessed the activation of both initiator and executor caspase-8 and caspase-3. <xref rid="f0010" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>C shows that incubation of cells with HOCl–LDL led to a 2-fold increase of caspase-8 activity (compared to LDL), with no significant difference between wild-type and FADD<sup>def</sup> cells. Only background caspase-8 activity was present in Casp-8<sup>def</sup> cells. As anticipated from PARP cleavage (<xref rid="f0010" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>B), HOCl–LDL activated caspase-3 in wild-type, FADD<sup>def</sup> and Casp-8<sup>def</sup> cells (<xref rid="f0010" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>D). In contrast, overexpression of mitochondria-localized Bcl-2 prevented HOCl–LDL-induced activation of caspase-8 and caspase-3 (<xref rid="f0010" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>E and F). Together, these data suggest that the assembly of a FADD- and caspase-8-containing death-receptor complex is dispensable for HOCl–LDL-induced apoptosis, whereas Bcl-2 overexpression prevented HOCl–LDL-mediated PARP cleavage and activation of caspase-3 and caspase-8, indicating that the mitochondrial apoptotic cascade is involved.</p>
      <p>Although ROS play a significant role in modulating the intracellular signaling that leads to T-cell proliferation, recent data suggest that ROS also interfere with signaling events that affect T-cell survival and activation <xref rid="b0110" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>. ROS appear to regulate apoptosis by affecting the extrinsic but preferentially the intrinsic pathway. Previous findings addressed that highly purified populations of primary T-cells produce ROS <xref rid="b0110" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>. We now show that HOCl–LDL induced formation of ROS in wild-type, FADD<sup>def</sup> and Casp-8<sup>def</sup> cells (<xref rid="f0015" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>A) and that ROS levels increased with an increasing oxidant:lipoprotein molar ratio. When compared to wild-type and Casp-8<sup>def</sup> cells, HOCl–LDL-mediated ROS formation was slightly lower in FADD<sup>def</sup> cells, indicating that FADD could be involved in ROS production. However, overexpression of Bcl-2 in Jurkat cells totally blocked HOCl–LDL-induced ROS accumulation (<xref rid="f0015" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>B). Preincubation of wild-type Jurkat cells with the antioxidant N-acetylcysteine prior to treatment with HOCl–LDL decreased ROS formation (<xref rid="f0015" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>C) and apoptosis (data not shown) in further consequence. In summary, our data show that FADD is slightly involved in HOCl–LDL-induced ROS formation and that overexpression of Bcl-2 prevents ROS formation. Therefore, we conclude that HOCl–LDL preferentially activates the intrinsic, mitochondrial apoptotic pathway.</p>
      <p>The capacity of HOCl–LDL to induce the apoptotic machinery has been investigated in epithelial cells <xref rid="b0070" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>, human monocytes and myelomonocytic cell lines <xref rid="b0115 b0120 b0125" ref-type="bibr">[23–25]</xref>. HOCl–LDL has been reported to induce a marked caspase-dependent increase of apoptosis, loss of mitochondrial membrane potential and activation of caspase-3, -8, and -9 in U937 cells <xref rid="b0120" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>. While HOCl–LDL was operative via extrinsic and intrinsic apoptotic pathways in U937 cells <xref rid="b0120 b0125" ref-type="bibr">[24,25]</xref>, the preferential pathway in T-cells involves the intrinsic route (<xref rid="f0005 f0010 f0015" ref-type="fig">Figs. 1–3</xref>). The fact that overexpression of Bcl-2 in Jurkat cells or the use of N-acetylcysteine interferes with ROS formation (<xref rid="f0015" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>B and C) and apoptosis in further consequence (data not shown) is indicative for mitochondrial involvement. Overexpression of Bcl-2 in U937 cells even prevented translocation of proapoptotic Bax but failed to prevent ROS generation <xref rid="b0125" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>. This indicates that in U937 cells ROS is an upstream signal to promote mitochondrial damage <xref rid="b0125" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>. The low activation of caspase-8 (but pronounced caspase-3 and PARP cleavage) in wild-type cells after 24 h (<xref rid="f0005" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>B) as well as caspase activation and PARP cleavage in FADD<sup>def</sup> or Casp-8<sup>def</sup> cells and their inhibition by Bcl-2 is of further support for the intrinsic pathway in T-cells initiated by HOCl–LDL (<xref rid="f0010" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>). Most importantly, caspase-dependent activation in Jurkat cells induced by HOCl–LDL could be inhibited by the specific caspase-3 (7-DEVD.fmk) and caspase-9 inhibitor (Z-LEHD.fmk) (data not shown) even at lower (lipo)protein concentrations and a lower oxidant:lipoprotein molar ratio as reported for cells of monocytic origin <xref rid="b0120 b0125" ref-type="bibr">[24,25]</xref>.</p>
      <p>Using an antibody raised against HOCl–LDL <xref rid="b0095" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>, HOCl-modified epitopes were found in inflammatory conditions, where T-cells are involved <xref rid="b0075 b0080 b0085" ref-type="bibr">[15–17]</xref>. We here aimed to identify colocalization of HOCl-modified proteins with T-cells. Therefore triple labeling experiments were performed. HOCl-modified proteins colocalize with MPO and CD3-positive T-cells in areas of beginning trophoblast invasion in first trimester decidua basalis (<xref rid="f0020" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref>A), demonstrating involvement of the MPO–H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>–halide system. Once heavily invaded, only colocalization of HOCl-modified proteins with MPO was detectable in first trimester tissue (<xref rid="f0020" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref>B). The lack of CD3-positive T-cells (not shown) is apparently due to a defence mechanism of the invading trophoblast cells expressing the apoptosis inducing Fas-ligand to protect themselves against activated alloreactive maternal leukocytes <xref rid="b0130" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>.</p>
      <p>Apoptosis is a physiological process to maintain tissue homeostasis and to complement cell differentiation, migration, and proliferation. Even under pathological conditions, programmed cell death could represent a first line of defence initiated by immune dysregulation as a local response of T-cells. T-cells are abundantly present during early and later stages of inflammatory conditions where modification of (lipo)proteins by the MPO–H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>–chloride system could amplify this process. We here show that HOCl–LDL, a physiologically occurring oxidative LDL modification, preferentially activates the intrinsic apoptotic pathway. The specific signaling cascades promoted by HOCl–LDL in wild-type and mutant Jurkat cell lines are currently under investigation.</p>

        <p>HOCl–LDL induces apoptosis wild-type Jurkat cells: (A) TUNEL assay (upper panel, green signal) and DNA 7-AAD staining (lower panel) of cells in the presence of mAb CH-11 or 500 μg/ml lipoprotein. The arrows point to morphologically changed nuclei, showing signs of apoptosis. (B) Cells were incubated with 500 μg/ml LDL or HOCl–LDL (oxidant:lipoprotein molar of 800:1) at indicated times. Cell lysates were subjected to SDS–PAGE and Western blotting. Membranes were incubated with anti-caspase-8, anti-caspase-3 or anti-PARP as primary antibodies. One representative experiment out of three is shown: (arrow) procaspase-8 or -3; (*) 116 kDa full length PARP; (**) 86 kDa cleaved PARP.

Cells were harvested, stained with propidium iodide (PI) and subjected to FACS analysis (A). Cell lysates were subjected to SDS–PAGE, proteins were transferred, and membranes were incubated with anti-PARP (B). One representative experiment out of three is shown. (C and D) WT, FADD<sup>def</sup> and Casp-8<sup>def</sup> or (E and F) WT and Bcl-2 cells were treated with 500 μg/ml lipoprotein for 4 h. Activation of caspase-8 (C, E) and caspase-3 (D, F) was measured using Ac-IETD-AMC/Ac-DEVD-AMC as substrates. (C–F) Caspase activity is given in nmoles AMC/min/μg protein.</p>
