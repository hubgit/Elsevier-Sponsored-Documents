        <title>Abstract</title>
        <p>ParA Walker ATPases form part of the machinery that promotes better-than-random segregation of bacterial genomes. ParA proteins normally occur in one of two forms, differing by their N-terminal domain (NTD) of approximately 100 aa, which is generally associated with site-specific DNA binding. Unusually, and for as yet unknown reasons, <italic>parA</italic> (<italic>incC</italic>) of IncP-1 plasmids is translated from alternative start codons producing two forms, IncC1 (364 aa) and IncC2 (259 aa), whose ratio varies between hosts. IncC2 could be detected as an oligomeric form containing dimers, tetramers and octamers, but the N-terminal extension present in IncC1 favours nucleotide-stimulated dimerisation as well as high-affinity and ATP-dependent non-specific DNA binding. The IncC1 NTD does not dimerise or bind DNA alone, but it does bind IncC2 in the presence of nucleotides. Mixing IncC1 and IncC2 improved polymerisation and DNA binding. Thus, the NTD may modulate the polymerisation interface, facilitating polymerisation/depolymerisation and DNA binding, to promote the cycle that drives partitioning.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>ParA ATPases are a ubiquitous family of proteins associated with directed movement within the bacterial cell of other proteins with or without additional attached macromolecules, such as DNA.<xref rid="bib1 bib2" ref-type="bibr"><sup>1,2</sup></xref> They are best known for their role in plasmid and chromosome partitioning, where they work with a ParB protein that binds to a centromere-like sequence within the DNA molecule to be partitioned.<xref rid="bib3 bib4" ref-type="bibr"><sup>3,4</sup></xref> They are also associated with directing the segregation of molecular machines, such as chemotaxis protein factories.<xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr"><sup>5</sup></xref> Their ability to bind and hydrolyse ATP apparently provides the energy required to drive this movement.<xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr"><sup>6</sup></xref> For actin-like ParM ATPases, it is proposed that ParM ATP is added to the outer ends of a ParM filament and that paired ParR–<italic>parC</italic> complexes (the centromere binding protein and DNA, respectively) bind to this and favour ATP hydrolysis to ADP, which loosens the binding, allowing the plasmid–ParR complexes to separate and follow the growing tips of the ParM filament.<xref rid="bib7 bib8 bib9 bib10 bib11" ref-type="bibr"><sup>7–11</sup></xref> There is a body of evidence demonstrating that ParB proteins can also pair their binding sites<xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr"><sup>12</sup></xref> and that ParA proteins form filaments<xref rid="bib13 bib14 bib15 bib16" ref-type="bibr"><sup>13–16</sup></xref> and show dynamic movement within the bacterial cell.<xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr"><sup>16</sup></xref> The recent ParM–ParR–<italic>parC</italic> models referred to above may also apply to these systems, but this is not yet clear.</p>
      <p>Alignment of the ParA protein sequences identifies two major forms depending on whether the protein starts just before the Walker ATPase box A or includes an N-terminal extension of approximately 100 aa, which generally contains a helix–turn–helix (HTH) motif (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>a). These longer ParA proteins are plasmid encoded and normally bind DNA specifically to autoregulate their cognate <italic>par</italic> operon—for example, ParA from P1<xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr"><sup>17</sup></xref> and SopA from plasmid F.<xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr"><sup>18</sup></xref> Specific DNA binding by ParA proteins is stimulated by the presence of ADP and inhibited by ATP.<xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr"><sup>19</sup></xref> This ATP–ADP switch in ParA activity is hypothesised to enable ParA to respond to the cell cycle of the host, segregating the plasmid DNA in the presence of ATP, whose levels are higher in exponential phase cells, and repressing expression from the <italic>par</italic> operon once this ATP is hydrolysed to ADP.<xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr"><sup>20</sup></xref> This extra domain could therefore be entirely devoted to an autoregulatory function.</p>
      <p>In systems with ParA proteins lacking this domain, autoregulation is normally carried out by the cognate ParB protein—for example, those encoded by pTAR<xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr"><sup>21</sup></xref> and <italic>Caulobacter crescentus</italic>.<xref rid="bib22" ref-type="bibr"><sup>22</sup></xref> In plasmid RK2, the <italic>par</italic> operon is autoregulated by the combination of the RK2 ParB protein KorB<xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr"><sup>23</sup></xref> and KorA, a 101-aa repressor protein encoded by an alternative open-reading frame in a different reading frame within the first section of the RK2 <italic>parA</italic> gene <italic>incC</italic>.<xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr"><sup>24</sup></xref> Despite this, the RK2 <italic>parA</italic> gene <italic>incC</italic> does encode a long ParA protein, IncC1, but uniquely, to date, <italic>incC</italic> has a second translational start site, thus producing IncC2, equivalent to short ParA (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>b and c).<xref rid="bib24 bib25" ref-type="bibr"><sup>24,25</sup></xref> IncC1 has not been shown to have DNA binding activity, and sequence alignments in the N-terminal region show only marginal similarity to the HTH region of other ParA proteins (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>a). Deletion analysis has shown that <italic>incC</italic> functions as a key component of an active partitioning apparatus that is important in <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> as well as other bacteria and that <italic>incC2</italic> is generally sufficient for this activity,<xref rid="bib2 bib26 bib27 bib28" ref-type="bibr"><sup>2,26–28</sup></xref> although this is when the normal control over <italic>incC</italic> and <italic>korB</italic> expression had been removed. In the apparent absence of a role for IncC1 in autoregulation, it is not clear what function encoding both proteins may serve. One approach to increase our understanding of their roles is to determine how the biochemical properties of IncC1 and IncC2 differ. In this study, we compared IncC1 and IncC2, showing that the N-terminal domain (NTD) modulates the polymerisation and non-specific DNA binding properties of this partitioning protein. We suggest that these may be additional functions of NTDs of long ParA proteins that may play an important auxiliary role in the partitioning cycle, possibly by regulating polymerisation and aiding depolymerisation.</p>

        <p>Although IncC1 and IncC2 are made <italic>in vivo</italic>,<xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr"><sup>24</sup></xref> the number and ratio of the two forms have not been estimated quantitatively. Western blotting was therefore used to detect IncC in <italic>E. coli</italic> and <italic>Pseudomonas putida</italic> as examples of distinct hosts (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>d). Although both forms were detected in each species, the ratios differed significantly: the number of IncC1:IncC2 monomers per log-phase bacterium was 1627:145 for <italic>E. coli</italic> (10:1) and was 496:487 for <italic>P. putida</italic> (1:1). In stationary-phase bacteria, the number of IncC1:IncC2 monomers was 797:219 for <italic>E. coli</italic> (4:1) and was 56:162 for <italic>P. putida</italic> (1:3). While genetic analysis has shown that IncC2 is sufficient for partitioning,<xref rid="bib26 bib28" ref-type="bibr"><sup>26,28</sup></xref> these results suggest that IncC1 may actually play the dominant role in some contexts.</p>

        <title>The NTD favours dimer formation by IncC1 in the presence of nucleotides</title>
        <p>IncC1 and IncC2 proteins were purified to &gt; 90% as described in <xref rid="sec1" ref-type="sec">Materials and Methods</xref> (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>ai and ii). The purified proteins were relatively unstable in the absence of a nucleotide and tended to precipitate when stored for a number of days at 4 °C. The oligomeric state was initially determined using glutaraldehyde cross-linking (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>b). In the absence of added nucleotides, IncC1 and IncC2 were converted to high-molecular-weight complexes that would not enter the gel (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>bi and v); however, reproducibly, at low glutaraldehyde concentrations, IncC2 was detected in lower oligomeric forms. In the presence of ATP, IncC1 and IncC2 became more soluble (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>c) and a dimer was detected as a dominant form but with more IncC2 in monomeric form (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>bii and vi). With ATPγS and ADP, monomeric and dimeric forms were dominant for IncC1, while only high-molecular-weight forms were detected for IncC2 (Fig. 2biii, iv, vii and viii).</p>
        <p>ATPase assays performed as described in <xref rid="sec1" ref-type="sec">Materials and Methods</xref> showed that while IncC1 and IncC2 do have significant activity at 37 °C (approximately 30 nM ATP hydrolysed/μM IncC/min), they show no activity at 4 °C, the temperature at which all cross-linking, area-under-the-curve (AUC) and electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA) experiments were carried out. Thus, hydrolysis of ATP during the experiments should not be a complicating factor in the interpretation of the results.</p>
        <p>To determine whether the NTD of IncC1 (amino acids 1–105) forms a self-sufficient dimerisation domain, we expressed, purified and glutaraldehyde cross-linked it alone (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>bix). Much of the protein remained monomeric (11 kDa), while a small amount of the protein formed trimers (33 kDa). By velocity sedimentation analysis, this domain appeared entirely monomeric, independently of whether ATP was present or not (data not shown). Thus, the NTD does not provide an independent dimerisation domain but modulates the activity of residues present in IncC2.</p>
        <p>Velocity sedimentation experiments with 30 μM IncC1 and varying ATP concentrations confirmed that IncC1 forms a dimer (mass = 80 kDa, 2.3<italic>S</italic>) in the presence of this nucleotide; in the absence of ATP, the soluble IncC1 that is detectable is exclusively monomeric (mass = 40 kDa, 1.6<italic>S</italic>) (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>ai). Plotting the dimer concentration at increasing ATP concentrations (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>aii) enabled the apparent dissociation constant (<italic>K</italic><sub>app</sub>) of IncC1 binding ATP to be calculated as 7.7 μM, considerably lower than the apparent <italic>K</italic><sub>d</sub> values for other ParA proteins, which are in the range of 33–100 μM.<xref rid="bib13 bib14 bib19 bib22" ref-type="bibr"><sup>13,14,19,22</sup></xref> Magnesium was important for coordinating the nucleotide, with the <italic>K</italic><sub>app</sub> being 130-fold higher (940 μM for 20 μM IncC1) when Mg<sup>2+</sup> was absent (data not shown). With magnesium, all of IncC1 is dimeric at or above 30 μM ATP, approximately one ATP molecule per IncC1 monomer. ADP also caused the formation of IncC1 dimers (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>bi), but with a higher <italic>K</italic><sub>app</sub> (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>bii; 54 μM). Hill analysis<xref rid="bib29" ref-type="bibr"><sup>29</sup></xref> of the data indicated that there was no cooperativity with ATP, whereas the ADP-induced dimerisation was highly cooperative involving two sites, the second of which was calculated to have a 1000-fold higher affinity.</p>
        <p>The IncC1 dimer formed in the presence of ADP has a sedimentation value different from that formed with ATP (2.1 ± 0.02<italic>S</italic> compared with 2.3 ± 0.08<italic>S</italic>; <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>c), which could imply a different conformation. By contrast, in similar experiments, IncC2 showed the presence of low levels of dimers, tetramers and octamers, independently of the presence of nucleotides (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>d), although the dimeric form was increased by the presence of ATP. Deletion of even 23 N-terminal amino acids resulted in properties similar to IncC2 (data not shown). Thus, an intact NTD is essential for the very clear differences in oligomerisation between IncC1 and IncC2: it appears to prevent oligomerisation in the absence of nucleotide and limits it to dimerisation in the presence of ATP.</p>

        <title>IncC1 exhibits higher ATP-stimulated affinity for DNA than IncC2</title>
        <p>Although no DNA binding by IncC was observed previously,<xref rid="bib30" ref-type="bibr"><sup>30</sup></xref> we reinvestigated this using a mixture of whole plasmids with and without the central control region of RK2, which was thought most likely to contain binding sites. In the absence of ATP, IncC1 (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref>ai) and IncC2 (data not shown) were found to favour binding to supercoiled DNA, which was fully retarded in EMSAs at twofold lower protein concentrations than the linear DNA. No preference for plasmids containing RK2 central control region DNA with pSMB200 <italic>versus</italic> pSMB201 was observed. Velocity sedimentation performed with a 15 nM mixture of supercoiled and open circular pSMB201 DNAs (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref>bi) also indicated an IncC1 preference for supercoiled DNA: the sedimentation coefficient of the peak corresponding to supercoiled DNA was more sensitive to increasing IncC1 concentrations than that of the open circular form. A change in sedimentation rate was not observed until the concentration of IncC1 reached between 0.9 and 3 μM, consistent with the concentration at which EMSA showed the transition from unretarded state to complete retardation (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref>ai).</p>
        <p>By contrast, the presence of ATP caused gradual retardation in EMSA experiments with both linear and supercoiled plasmid DNAs from as low as 10 nM IncC1 (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref>aii). Velocity sedimentation of increasing concentrations of supercoiled DNA in the presence of ATP, to create an equal mixture of IncC1 monomers and dimers (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref>bii), showed that it is the IncC1-ATP dimer that binds to DNA, while the concentration of the monomer peak remains constant. All of the dimer bound to the DNA at a concentration of 10–20 nM DNA, corresponding to one dimer of IncC1 per 10–20 bases of DNA. Once all of the dimer was bound (when there was excess of double-stranded DNA), the <italic>S</italic> value of the remaining IncC1 was seen to shift from 1.6 to 1.9, midway between the <italic>S</italic> values of the monomer and the dimer, suggesting a fast equilibrium between monomer and dimer. Since a mixture of IncC1 and ATP alone does not give such fast exchange between dimer and monomer, this implies that the presence of uncoated DNA may promote dimer/monomer exchange.</p>
        <p>ATP increases IncC1 affinity for DNA by more than 30-fold (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref>c) and alters the mode of DNA binding: in the absence of ATP, the DNA appears to be shifted straight to the top of the gel, whereas in the presence of ATP, DNA mobility decreases slowly, implying progressive accumulation of protein on the plasmid DNA. ATPγS also increased IncC1's affinity for DNA by more than 15-fold. The mode of DNA binding in the presence of ADP is similar to that in the absence of any nucleotide, and it has a slight inhibitory effect of approximately 1.5-fold on DNA binding, which is consistent with ADP-IncC1 having a conformation different from that of ATP–IncC1 (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref>c). A semi-logarithmic graph of the data demonstrated that in the presence of ATP, IncC1 binding to DNA is biphasic, with the transition between the two phases occurring at a concentration sufficient for one IncC1 dimer every 20 bp (approximate). This is also approximately the concentration at which the lower-affinity forms of IncC1 cause retardation. Hill analysis<xref rid="bib29" ref-type="bibr"><sup>29</sup></xref> of the data indicated that, with both ATP and ATPγS, there is cooperativity involving only two sites, presumably those present in the IncC1 dimer. For free IncC1 or in the presence of ADP, there is very strong cooperativity involving multiple sites, with as many as 18 predicted from one data set. In the presence of ATP, mobility of the entire DNA gradually changed in a concerted way, suggesting negative cooperativity such that distribution of IncC1 evenly between the DNA molecules is favoured, perhaps due to conformational changes in the DNA as a result of IncC1 binding. Alternatively, this could be due to a fast equilibrium of IncC1 continually binding to the DNA and then detaching.</p>
        <p>ATP also stimulated IncC2 binding to DNA, but the stimulation was only 2-fold and IncC2 also had a much lower overall affinity for DNA than IncC1 (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref>d). In the absence of nucleotides, the difference between the affinities of the two proteins is approximately 7-fold: 0.5 μM for complete retardation by IncC1 compared with 3.5 μM for IncC2. In the presence of ATP, the difference between the affinities of the two proteins for DNA is 18-fold. Thus, the NTD of IncC1 has a major effect on IncC DNA binding properties. Interestingly, ATPase activity of both IncC1 and IncC2 was stimulated (about 45% from about 30–42 nM ATP hydrolysed/μM IncC/min) by the presence of either CCC or OC DNA, although not so much as when KorB was also present and the DNA was a plasmid containing an O<sub>B</sub> site (more than 2-fold; unpublished data). It therefore seems unlikely that interaction of IncC1 or IncC2 with DNA is likely to switch on its ATPase activity in a major way.</p>

        <title>Analysis of IncC1 NTD</title>
        <p>Deletion mutants (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref>a) were constructed in approximately 20-aa steps, with endpoints defined by the predicted secondary structures of the NTDs of other ParA proteins, ensuring that complete α-helices and β-sheets were included or deleted from each mutant derivative. The predicted structure of the IncC1-NTD was also consistent with the known structure of the Ffh signal recognition particle protein, which shows sequence similarities to ParA proteins.<xref rid="bib31 bib32" ref-type="bibr"><sup>31,32</sup></xref> EMSAs with supercoiled plasmid DNA (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref>b) showed that even removal of 23 aa from the N-terminus decreased efficiency of DNA binding: by 1.5-fold in the absence of any nucleotide and by 5-fold in the presence of ATP. Deletion of 41 aa had a slight additional effect (2-fold and 8-fold in the absence and in the presence of ATP, respectively), but the greatest decline in DNA binding was shown by IncC1-NΔ60 and IncC1-NΔ80, both of which no longer contain the region that in other ParA proteins encodes the putative HTH domain. These mutants both retarded the DNA at similar concentrations as with IncC2—a difference of 7-fold in the absence of any nucleotide and that of 18-fold in the presence of ATP as compared with wild-type IncC1. There was also a difference in the gradual reduction in DNA mobility in the presence of ATP: IncC1-NΔ23, IncC1-NΔ41 and IncC1-NΔ80 all behaved similarly to IncC1, while IncC1-NΔ60 behaved more like IncC2, retarding the DNA over a narrower protein concentration, which demonstrates that binding is more cooperative. A point mutation in the NTD of IncC1 (S55N) did not alter the basic affinity of IncC1 for supercoiled DNA but did slightly reduce the ability of ATP to stimulate binding (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref>b). Tests for the dimerisation of the deletion derivatives revealed that even the smallest deletion (23 aa) resulted in complete loss of ATP-stimulated dimerisation possessed by IncC1 (data not shown). When the NTD of IncC1 was purified alone, it did not retard the DNA at all at any of the concentrations tested (data not shown). Thus, the influence of the NTD on IncC behaviour depends on the whole domain being intact and in the context of a complete IncC protein.</p>
        <p>To determine whether the NTD of IncC1 interacts with IncC2, we cross-linked them in the presence of various nucleotides (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6</xref>b). In the presence of either ATP or ADP, the NTD was found to interact with IncC2, forming a new species with an estimated relative molecular mass of 41 kDa, which was not seen in the absence of nucleotides. This correlates with the predicted role of the NTD in regulating ATP/ADP-stimulated dimerisation in IncC1, suggesting that it interacts with an area of IncC2 that is exposed when the protein binds a nucleotide.</p>

        <title>IncC2 enhances DNA binding by IncC1</title>
        <p>IncC1 and IncC2 were mixed and glutaraldehyde cross-linked in the presence of various nucleotides (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6</xref>a). Western blots showed that the two proteins form a complex corresponding to a heterodimer, with an estimated relative molecular mass of 68 kDa. IncC1 homodimers (78 kDa) were also visible. This species could also be seen in the absence of nucleotide, albeit only at the lowest glutaraldehyde concentration (0.001%) as part of a ladder of IncC2 oligomers, suggesting that it may originate from the insoluble or high-molecular-weight material than a real heterodimer in this case. Interestingly, with ATP, the presence of IncC1 reduced the concentration of monomeric IncC2 at higher glutaraldehyde concentrations, and there were also additional high-molecular-weight complexes visible, as compared with IncC2 alone. These suggest that IncC1 stimulates IncC2 polymerisation in the presence of ATP. In the presence of ATP, the IncC1 dimer and heterodimer with IncC2 were less prevalent at higher glutaraldehyde concentrations, suggesting that they were incorporated into growing polymers. This does not occur to the same extent with ADP (data not shown), implying that ATP is the nucleotide required for polymerisation.</p>
        <p>With supercoiled pSMB201, DNA retardation by a 1:1 mixture of IncC1/IncC2 as well as each protein demonstrated that IncC2 enhances the DNA binding of IncC1, independently of the nucleotide present (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6</xref>c). Thus, the IncC1/IncC2 mixture has a higher affinity for the DNA than IncC1 alone, and this is not dependent on the form of nucleotide bound. In the presence of ATP, for example, 54 nM concentration of the IncC1/IncC2 mixture begins to retard the DNA, whereas 62 nM IncC1 alone was required to retard the DNA to the same extent. In the presence of ADP, the IncC1/IncC2 mixture showed approximately a 1.6-fold higher affinity than IncC1.</p>

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>Biochemical studies on a variety of ParA proteins have revealed not only many similarities but also distinct differences in protein properties, some of which may be due to the approximately 100-aa NTD that is present in some but not all ParA proteins. Comparative studies on the naturally occurring RK2 IncC1 and IncC2 proteins reported here show that the NTD of IncC1 can profoundly influence the activity of IncC2, the shorter protein, despite the latter apparently being functional for active partitioning <italic>in vivo</italic>.<xref rid="bib26" ref-type="bibr"><sup>26</sup></xref> A major difference of IncC from a number of other ParA proteins is that the addition of ATP aids the solubility of the IncC proteins, apparently priming them to enter the partitioning cycle by addition to the growing ParA filament, whereas for many other ParA proteins, ATP promotes polymerisation independently of other key parts of the partitioning machinery. Thus, IncC may represent a currently unique biochemical model of a partitioning cycle based on polymerisation of soluble ParA initiated by the cognate ParB bound to its centromere-like DNA sequence. These differences may reflect both the assays performed and how polymerisation is measured, but since our methods were based on previous reports with a variety of systems, it may be that they represent inherent properties of the RK2 system and lay the basis for investigating the depairing and separation stages of the partitioning cycle.</p>
      <p>Another feature of our data is that the two <italic>incC</italic> products show such distinct oligomerisation and DNA binding properties (summarised in <xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7</xref>). ATP and ADP promote IncC1 to form dimers, albeit with distinct properties—only ATP binding gives high, non-sequence-specific affinity for DNA. Thus, apart from the lack of ADP-dependent sequence-specific DNA binding (which correlates with IncC1 NTD lacking strong similarity to the HTH DNA recognition motif; <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>a), IncC1 has many properties typical of other long ParA proteins.<xref rid="bib3 bib14 bib17 bib19" ref-type="bibr"><sup>3,14,17,19</sup></xref> By contrast, IncC2 lacks the high-affinity non-specific DNA binding activity typical of short ParA proteins. It forms dimers less readily than IncC1 while having a greater tendency to continue polymerising once dimers are formed as indicated by both cross-linking and AUC. Since IncC2 is sufficient for partitioning,<xref rid="bib26" ref-type="bibr"><sup>26</sup></xref> the strong non-sequence-specific DNA binding cannot be essential for the partition cycle but may increase efficiency in some way—for example, by increasing local concentrations of ParA or reducing ATP hydrolysis in the absence of the cognate ParB. Understanding how the NTD of IncC1 modulates ParA protein activity may establish how the equivalent domain in other ParA proteins contributes to the partitioning cycle.</p>
      <p>The entire NTD is necessary for IncC1's greater tendency (compared with IncC2) to form dimers irrespective of the bound nucleotide, but the 105-aa region does not dimerise autonomously. Therefore, it seems unlikely that these proteins arose from the fusion of a small dimeric DNA binding protein with a standard short ParA (IncC2) protein. Our data also suggest that the IncC1 NTD forms a separate domain that, in the presence of a nucleotide, changes position or conformation and associates more closely with the common domain of IncC1 and IncC2. This appears to potentiate the dimerisation interface but also blocks or alters surfaces needed for further polymerisation since IncC2, lacking this domain, has a greater tendency to oligomerise to high-molecular-weight forms. The importance of the nucleotide in determining active conformation is emphasised by the differences in sedimentation of IncC1-ATP and IncC1-ADP, as well as their DNA binding properties. Mapping the surfaces needed for the macromolecular interactions that IncC may be involved in (IncC–IncC, IncC<sub>2</sub>–IncC<sub>2</sub>, IncC–DNA, IncC–KorB and IncC2–NTD) should help make more sense of the oligomerisation process and its control. However, the current state of knowledge is consistent with the idea that IncC-ATP is recruited to the filament that drives partitioning but then undergoes ATP hydrolysis and conformational change, which is a key step in the cycle proposed recently.<xref rid="bib9 bib11" ref-type="bibr"><sup>9,11</sup></xref></p>
      <p>Although it is conceivable that the alternative <italic>incC</italic> translation starts could simply be a flexible way to supply sufficient IncC in different species, Western blotting showed that IncC1 can be either dominant (IncC1/IncC2 in <italic>E. coli</italic> is 10:1) or equal to IncC2 (<italic>P. putida</italic>) depending on the host. This implies that the distinct properties of IncC1, particularly the non-specific high affinity for DNA, are important and suggests that IncC1 and IncC2 are not totally interchangeable. While the above ratios suggest that IncC1 might be the “senior partner” in the system, the data also suggest that IncC1/IncC2 heterodimers bind DNA as efficiently as or better than IncC1 alone; hence, producing a mixture may be the real purpose of the system. The role of non-sequence-specific DNA binding has been recently discussed,<xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr"><sup>14</sup></xref> but we must repeat some of the points here. First, although ATP-stimulated non-specific DNA binding for ParA protein from <italic>Bacillus subtilis</italic> (Soj) is important for polymerisation to form filaments,<xref rid="bib32" ref-type="bibr"><sup>32</sup></xref> our data show that this is not the case for IncC. Second, as for the SopA protein of F,<xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr"><sup>14</sup></xref> non-specific DNA binding may reduce polymerisation. DNA binding of IncC1-ATP certainly appears to be non-cooperative and DNA-bound IncC could thus act as a store of the protein until it is required during segregation. KorB bound to DNA in a particular way that is characteristic of paired plasmid molecules may release IncC from DNA and stimulate polymerisation. A third possibility is that IncC may condense DNA, compacting the multiple <italic>parS</italic> sites to form an organised nucleoprotein complex, a role predicted for Soj in <italic>B. subtilis</italic>.<xref rid="bib34" ref-type="bibr"><sup>34</sup></xref> Chromosome condensation is important during eukaryotic mitosis, so it would not be surprising for the same to be true for prokaryotes. Compaction could prevent sister origin regions from becoming intertwined and decrease the resistance as they are moved through the cytoplasm.<xref rid="bib34" ref-type="bibr"><sup>34</sup></xref> A fourth possibility is that DNA forms a scaffold on which the partitioning apparatus assembles. Future studies looking into the effect on partitioning of point mutations that inactivate this property in IncC1 but leave other properties intact should be instructive in distinguishing between these possibilities.</p>
      <p>The key similarities and differences between IncC1 and IncC2 reported in this article are summarised in <xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7</xref>. Despite their differences, IncC1 and IncC2 interact, producing heterodimers, regardless of their nucleotide-bound state. Band shift experiments demonstrated that the DNA binding ability of the IncC1/IncC2 mixture, possibly the heterodimer itself, was greater than that of IncC1 or IncC2 homodimers. The ADP binding data suggest that conformational change in one subunit of a dimer can be transmitted to the other subunit. Therefore, the conformation promoted by an NTD on only one subunit of a dimer may increase DNA binding strength more than an NTD on both subunits. Alternatively, an IncC1 dimer and an IncC2 dimer together may bind more strongly than a homogeneous mixture of homodimers. This may increase the effectiveness of the relatively low levels of IncC in the bacterial cell. Interaction between the IncC proteins may promote polymerisation of IncC2, either through nucleation by IncC1 or due to the formation of the heterodimer. Our data with IncC2 suggest that polymerisation occurs through dimer intermediates. The observation that nucleotide binding promotes binding of the non-covalently attached NTD to IncC2 suggests that these domain–domain interactions are responsible for both the potentiation and the inhibition of different properties. It is plausible that the interaction between the two forms is particularly potent because the heterodimer may gain from the positive contribution of the NTD on one subunit to DNA binding without being dominated by the negative influence of the NTD on polymerisation, which would occur if present on both subunits. Seeing the NTD as a critical regulator of this process may help in understanding features of the different systems and direct further experiments to establish the interactions that control the various stages of the partitioning cycle.</p>

(a) Competition band shifts of IncC1 with linear and supercoiled DNAs plus and minus the central control region from RK2 (pSMB201, plasmid with central control region from RK2; pSMB200, pSMB201 without the central control region). Triangles represent increasing concentrations of each IncC1 in the retardation (in 1.5-fold steps, beginning with 18 nM). Band shift assays performed with supercoiled and digested pSMB200, same as pSMB201 but without the central control region and supercoiled pSMB200 on agarose gel (0.7%). (b-i) Velocity sedimentation of IncC1 titrated onto DNA. A 15 nM mixture of supercoiled (CCC) and open circular (OC) pSMB201 DNAs was titrated with IncC1. (ii) Velocity sedimentation of DNA titrated onto IncC1. IncC1 (34 μM) was titrated with supercoiled and open circular pSMB201 DNAs. A concentration of ATP was added such that there was a 1:1 ratio of IncC1 monomer/dimer. (c) Band shifts of IncC1 with no nucleotide, ATP and ADP.

        <p>Summary of polymerisation and DNA (dark vertical bar) binding activities observed for IncC1 (a), IncC2 (b) and the IncC1/IncC2 mixture (c) in the presence of nucleotide (small darker circles) ATP or ADP (for IncC1). The large light square/circle represents the IncC2 segment, while in (a) and (c), the small light square/circle represents the NTD. A key element of the model is that while ATP binding causes a conformational change for each protein, the change with ATP configures a DNA binding site, whereas that with ADP does not. Also note that the NTD is clamped onto the IncC2 portion by ATP but must move or be moved out of the way to allow further polymerisation.</p>
