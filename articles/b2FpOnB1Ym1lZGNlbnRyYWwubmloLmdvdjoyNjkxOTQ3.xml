        <title>Summary</title>
        <p>MIG-10/RIAM/lamellipodin (MRL) proteins link activated Ras-GTPases with actin regulatory Ena/VASP proteins to induce local changes in cytoskeletal dynamics and cell motility. MRL proteins alter monomeric (G):filamentous (F) actin ratios, but the impact of these changes had not been fully appreciated. We report here that the <italic>Drosophila</italic> MRL ortholog, <italic>pico</italic>, is required for tissue and organismal growth. Reduction in <italic>pico</italic> levels resulted in reduced cell division rates, growth retardation, increased G:F actin ratios and lethality. Conversely, <italic>pico</italic> overexpression reduced G:F actin ratios and promoted tissue overgrowth in an epidermal growth factor (EGF) receptor (EGFR)-dependent manner. Consistently, in HeLa cells, lamellipodin was required for EGF-induced proliferation. We show that pico and lamellipodin share the ability to activate serum response factor (SRF), a transcription factor that responds to reduced G:F-actin ratios via its co-factor Mal. Genetics data indicate that <italic>mal</italic>/SRF levels are important for <italic>pico</italic>-mediated tissue growth. We propose that MRL proteins link EGFR activation to mitogenic SRF signaling via changes in actin dynamics.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>The construction of properly sized and functional tissues and organs during animal development requires tight control of cell growth, proliferation, differentiation, and death. Networks of intracellular signal transduction pathways that respond to various secreted ligands and cell surface proteins coordinate these processes. Elucidating the nature of the intracellular signaling networks that connect extracellular stimuli to basic cellular machinery controlling proliferation, growth, and morphology is not only critical for the understanding of tissue size regulation during normal development, but is also important for the identification of aberrant events underlying numerous disease processes, including cancer.</p>
      <p>A number of pathways regulating cellular development are initiated by ligation of transmembrane receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs), such as the epidermal growth factor (EGF) receptor (EGFR). One of the key mediators of RTK signaling is the Ras GTPase, capable of activating proteins harboring Ras association (RA) domains to initiate downstream signaling pathways, such as the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) cascade, and ultimately resulting in changes in gene transcription. The Ras/MAPK and other canonical RTK signaling pathways have been well characterized, yet they cannot account for all of the observed effects of their respective extracellular signals.</p>
      <p>The MIG-10/Rap1-GTP-interacting adaptor molecule (RIAM)/lamellipodin (Lpd) (MRL) proteins are a family of recently identified molecular adaptors, harboring an RA, pleckstrin homology (PH), and several proline-rich domains (<xref rid="bib17 bib18" ref-type="bibr">Krause et al., 2004; Lafuente et al., 2004</xref>). Several lines of evidence indicate that MRL proteins act downstream of Ras-like GTPases and transduce extracellular signals to changes in the actin cytoskeleton, cell motility, and adhesion. In particular, Lpd interacts with active Ras and RIAM with active Rap1. Consistent with this, only RIAM is required for Rap1-induced cell adhesion (<xref rid="bib18 bib25" ref-type="bibr">Lafuente et al., 2004; Rodriguez-Viciana et al., 2004</xref>). Lpd also binds to PI(3,4)P2 via its PH domain, which is sufficient for membrane targeting after platelet-derived growth factor stimulation (<xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr">Krause et al., 2004</xref>). Both Lpd and RIAM utilize their proline-rich motifs to directly interact with the Enabled (Ena)/vasodilator-stimulated phosphoprotein (VASP) actin regulators, known to regulate lamellipodia formation and cell migration (<xref rid="bib15 bib17 bib18" ref-type="bibr">Jenzora et al., 2005; Krause et al., 2004; Lafuente et al., 2004</xref>). In addition, Lpd knockdown impairs lamellipodia formation, whereas Lpd overexpression increases speed of lamellipodia protrusion in an Ena/VASP-dependent manner (<xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr">Krause et al., 2004</xref>). Finally, both Lpd and RIAM have been shown to alter the cellular ratio between monomeric (G) and filamentous (F) actin (<xref rid="bib17 bib18" ref-type="bibr">Krause et al., 2004; Lafuente et al., 2004</xref>), suggesting a wider role in regulating cell metabolism. Indeed, control of the G:F actin ratio is an essential way for cells to regulate gene transcription via the transcription factor serum response factor (SRF), and has been linked to changes in proliferation, migration, and differentiation (<xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr">Miralles et al., 2003</xref>).</p>
      <p>Here we report the characterization of the <italic>Drosophila</italic> MRL ortholog, which we have named <italic>pico</italic> on the basis of the retarded growth phenotype resulting from <italic>pico</italic> knockdown or loss-of-function mutant. Reduction in <italic>pico</italic> levels results in reduced rates of cell growth and proliferation, whereas ectopic expression of <italic>pico</italic> promotes coordinated cell growth and proliferation, leading to tissue overgrowth. <italic>pico</italic>'s effect on cell proliferation is conserved in its mammalian ortholog, Lpd. We present evidence that <italic>pico</italic> and Lpd link extracellular signaling to tissue growth via changes in actin dynamics and SRF activation. To our knowledge, this is the first time that MRL proteins have been implicated in controlling cell proliferation and tissue growth.</p>

        <title>Pico Encodes the Only MRL Protein in <italic>Drosophila</italic></title>
        <p>Phylogenetic analysis has shown that <italic>pico</italic> (<italic>CG11940</italic>) encodes the only member of the MRL family of proteins in <italic>Drosophila</italic> (<xref rid="bib17 bib18" ref-type="bibr">Krause et al., 2004; Lafuente et al., 2004</xref>). The organization of the <italic>pico</italic> transcription unit, located on the first chromosome at cytological position 18F2-4 (<xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">Consortium, 2003</xref>), is shown in <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>A. We identified two transcripts that are generated from alternative transcription start sites of the <italic>pico</italic> transcription unit: <italic>pico</italic> and <italic>pico-L</italic>. <italic>pico-L</italic> encodes a 1159 amino acid protein that is identical to the protein encoded by <italic>pico</italic>, except for the presence of an additional 128 N-terminal residues. Both pico proteins contain RA and PH domains and proline-rich Ena/VASP binding sites characteristic of the MRL proteins (<xref rid="bib17 bib18" ref-type="bibr">Krause et al., 2004; Lafuente et al., 2004</xref>; see <xref rid="app2" ref-type="sec">Supplemental Data</xref> and <xref rid="app2" ref-type="sec">Figure S1</xref> available online).</p>

        <title><italic>Pico</italic> Is Essential for Organismal Growth and Viability</title>
        <p>To determine the in vivo function of <italic>pico</italic>, we generated a mutant allele, <italic>pico<sup>k1</sup></italic>, by imprecise excision of a viable <italic>P</italic> element transposon, which we found inserted in the <italic>pico</italic> 5′ untranslated region. <italic>pico<sup>k1</sup></italic> showed little or no <italic>pico-L</italic> expression, reduced levels of <italic>pico</italic>, but wild-type levels of the neighboring gene <italic>CG11943</italic> mRNA (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>B), consistent with molecular analysis revealing a 2.81 kb deletion removing the 5′ end of <italic>pico-L</italic> and a large region upstream of the predicted <italic>pico</italic> transcription start site in this mutant (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>A). Hemizygous <italic>pico<sup>k1</sup></italic> animals were larval lethal and displayed phenotypes reminiscent of mutations in positive regulators of growth and proliferation: mutant larvae were dramatically reduced in size, with severely reduced endoreduplicated tissue and little or no detectable imaginal disc tissue; mutant larvae eventually died following an extended larval period of up to 2 weeks (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>C, and data not shown). Heat shock-induced co-overexpression of <italic>pico</italic> and <italic>pico-L</italic> rescued the hemizygous lethality of <italic>pico<sup>k1</sup></italic>, indicating that the lethality of <italic>pico<sup>k1</sup></italic> is due to disruption of the <italic>pico</italic> locus (data not shown). The presence of food in the guts of <italic>pico<sup>k1</sup></italic> mutant larvae verified that they had eaten, and suggests that the inhibition of larval growth may be caused by a cellular growth defect. To assess this, we examined the behavior of <italic>pico<sup>k1</sup></italic> mutant cells randomly generated in the wing imaginal disc by mitotic recombination. Homozygous <italic>pico<sup>k1</sup></italic> cells could not readily be detected, but were occasionally observed to achieve clone sizes of up to 15 cells in clones positively marked with GFP. Their predominantly basal localization indicated that they might be displaced from the basal surface of the disc epithelium (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figures 1</xref>D and 1E; <xref rid="app2" ref-type="sec">Figure S2</xref>). This phenotype is reminiscent of cells that have sustained inappropriate cell cycle arrest. However, unlike mutants that prevent passage through the cell cycle, but allow continued growth (<xref rid="bib22" ref-type="bibr">Neufeld et al., 1998</xref>), <italic>pico</italic> mutant cells did not become enlarged, suggesting that <italic>pico</italic> loss-of-function also results in a cellular growth defect.</p>

        <title>Knockdown of <italic>pico</italic> Results in Cell Growth and Proliferation Defects</title>
        <p>To further assess the cellular requirement for <italic>pico</italic>, we used a heritable double-stranded (ds) RNA interference (RNAi) approach to flexibly knockdown <italic>pico</italic> and <italic>pico-L</italic> levels. We generated stable lines of transgenic flies carrying an inverted repeat construct (<italic>pico<sup>IR</sup></italic>) capable of expressing intron-spliced hairpin dsRNA for a sequence common to <italic>pico</italic> and <italic>pico-L</italic> under GAL4-UAS control. Sequence analysis predicted minimal off-targets for <italic>pico<sup>IR</sup></italic> (0 off-targets from 459 possible 19 mers). Flies expressing this construct ubiquitously under the control of <italic>tubulin-GAL4</italic> (<italic>tub &gt; pico<sup>IR</sup></italic>) were semilethal; survivors were small compared to <italic>tubulin-GAL4</italic> siblings (<italic>tub &gt;</italic>) (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figures 2</xref>A and 2B). Levels of <italic>pico</italic> and <italic>pico-L</italic> mRNA were greatly reduced in <italic>tub &gt; pico<sup>IR</sup></italic> larvae compared with control animals, indicating knockdown of endogenous <italic>pico</italic> expression (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>C). We also found levels of ectopic Myc-tagged Pico were severely reduced by coexpression of <italic>pico<sup>IR</sup></italic> (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figures 2</xref>D and 2E). Ectopic overexpression of <italic>pico<sup>IR</sup></italic> in the developing wing using <italic>MS1096-GAL4</italic> (<italic>MS1096 &gt; pico<sup>IR</sup></italic>) resulted in a significant reduction in wing area (p &lt; 0.001; <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figures 2</xref>F and 2G). <italic>MS1096-GAL4</italic> is expressed at higher levels in the dorsal half of the developing wing pouch. Accordingly, <italic>MS1096 &gt; pico<sup>IR</sup></italic> wings were curled upwards slightly, indicating that, relative to the ventral wing blade, the dorsal wing blade was somewhat reduced in size (data not shown). As a single wing hair marks each adult wing cell, we measured the wing hair density to gauge cell size. The wing hair density in <italic>MS1096 &gt; pico<sup>IR</sup></italic> wings was significantly increased relative to wild type (p &lt; 0.01; <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figures 2</xref>F and 2G), indicating that the reduction in wing area was at least in part due to a reduction in cell size. An independent inverted repeat construct (National Institute of Genetics: <italic>11940R</italic>), showed qualitatively similar effects to <italic>pico<sup>IR</sup></italic>, suggesting that the growth defects we observed are not due to off-target effects (data not shown).</p>
        <p>To study the effects of changes in steady-state levels of <italic>pico</italic> in more detail in a defined cell population, we used <italic>en-GAL4</italic> to continuously drive <italic>pico<sup>IR</sup></italic> expression in the posterior compartment of the wing disc from the earliest stages of disc formation. Adult wing measurements showed that <italic>en-GAL4</italic>, <italic>UAS-pico<sup>IR</sup></italic> (<italic>en &gt; pico<sup>IR</sup></italic>) flies exhibited a specific reduction in the area of the posterior wing compartment (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>H). The ratio of posterior to anterior area of <italic>en &gt; pico<sup>IR</sup></italic> wings (1.33:1) was significantly reduced compared to that of control wings (1.68:1; p &lt; 0.01). To determine the effect of <italic>pico</italic> on cell cycle progression, we obtained cell cycle profiles using flow cytometry on live cells from dissociated <italic>en &gt; pico<sup>IR</sup></italic> wing imaginal discs. DNA profiles revealed that cells expressing <italic>pico<sup>IR</sup></italic> had normal cell cycle phasing, while forward scatter analysis confirmed that cells were slightly smaller than controls (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figures 2</xref>I and 2J). To assess in vivo cell division rates, we generated clones coexpressing GFP and <italic>pico<sup>IR</sup></italic> using the flip-out technique (<xref rid="bib22" ref-type="bibr">Neufeld et al., 1998</xref>) and counted the number of GFP-expressing cells per clone 38 hr after induction. Clones expressing <italic>pico<sup>IR</sup></italic> had significantly fewer cells than control clones expressing GFP alone (p &lt; 0.01), and therefore contained cells that divided at a slower rate (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figures 2</xref>K and 2L).</p>

        <title>Ectopic <italic>pico</italic> Promotes Coordinated Cell Growth and Proliferation</title>
        <p>To determine whether <italic>pico</italic> is limiting for tissue growth, we examined the effect of ectopically expressing <italic>pico</italic> in the wing. Ectopic <italic>pico</italic> resulted in significant wing overgrowth with little or no disruption of patterning (p &lt; 0.01; <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figures 3</xref>A and 3B). <italic>MS1096 &gt; pico</italic> wings were curled downwards slightly, indicating that, relative to the ventral wing blade, the dorsal wing blade was enlarged (data not shown). Ectopic <italic>pico</italic> had no effect on wing hair density, suggesting that increased tissue growth driven by <italic>pico</italic> results from an increased rate of cell division with a matching increase in growth rate. When <italic>pico</italic> was overexpressed together with <italic>pico<sup>IR</sup></italic>, the phenotypic effects of each alone were nullified, resulting in wings that were of wild-type size and appearance (data not shown). Ectopic expression of <italic>pico</italic> in the posterior compartment of the developing wing resulted in an expansion of the posterior tissue (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>C). The posterior to anterior area ratio of wings from <italic>en-GAL4</italic>, <italic>UAS-pico</italic> flies (2.03:1) was significantly increased compared to that of control wings (1.65:1; p &lt; 0.01). Flow cytometric analysis revealed that cells overexpressing <italic>pico</italic> had normal cell cycle phasing and were of a normal size (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figures 3</xref>D and 3E). Clones expressing <italic>pico</italic> had significantly more cells than control clones expressing GFP alone (p &lt; 0.01), and therefore contained cells that divided at a faster rate (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figures 3</xref>F and 3G). Therefore, in the context of the developing wing, ectopic <italic>pico</italic> induces a coordinated increase in cell cycle and cell growth rates, leading to substantial tissue overgrowth. Moderate ectopic expression of <italic>pico</italic> throughout the fly resulted in dose-dependent increase in body mass, indicating that <italic>pico</italic> functions as a general growth promoter in multiple tissues (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figures 3</xref>H–3J). These data show that the loss-of-function phenotype of <italic>pico</italic> is complementary to its gain-of-function phenotype. The gain-of-function phenotype appears to reflect the overactivation of the natural function of <italic>pico</italic>, which is to promote cell growth and proliferation.</p>

        <title><italic>Pico</italic> Partially Disrupts Epithelial Architecture but Does Not Induce Cell Death</title>
        <p>Mutations that slow the rate of cell proliferation can show intrinsic survival defects. Conversely, strong proliferative stimuli, such as the oncogenes E2F and Dp, can induce apoptosis, and net proliferation only occurs when apoptosis is simultaneously prevented. To determine whether cells expressing different levels of <italic>pico</italic> undergo cell death, we examined the effect of expressing <italic>pico</italic> or <italic>pico<sup>IR</sup></italic> in positively marked (GFP-positive) cells with <italic>ptc-GAL4</italic>. Cells undergoing apoptosis were identified by activated caspase 3 staining. Compared to controls expressing GFP alone, the zone of GFP-positive cells in discs ectopically expressing <italic>pico<sup>IR</sup></italic> was narrower and contained fewer cells (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>). We did not observe elevated activated caspase 3 staining, and all nuclei appeared normal, suggesting that cells with reduced <italic>pico</italic> levels did not have an intrinsic survival defect. Ectopic expression of <italic>pico</italic> under control of <italic>ptc-GAL4</italic> resulted in an expansion of the number of <italic>ptc &gt; GFP</italic> cells. <italic>Pico</italic> expressing cells often exhibited an abnormal distribution toward the basal side of the wing disc epithelium, despite appearing morphologically normal (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>). The effect of <italic>pico</italic> overexpression on adult wing size was not enhanced when apoptosis was suppressed by coexpression of the caspase inhibitor p35 (data not shown). Therefore, stimulation of growth by <italic>pico</italic> was not associated with an increase in apoptosis. Studies of the miRNA <italic>bantam</italic> have shown that genes stimulating cell proliferation can simultaneously suppress apoptosis (<xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">Brennecke et al., 2003</xref>). Therefore, we wondered whether <italic>pico</italic> could suppress proliferation-induced apoptosis caused by ectopic E2F and Dp. As previously reported, cells overexpressing E2F and Dp under the control of <italic>ptc-GAL4</italic> showed pyknotic nuclei and elevated levels of activated caspase 3 in basal optical sections of wing discs, indicative of apoptosis (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>) (<xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">Brennecke et al., 2003</xref>). Coexpression of <italic>pico</italic> with E2F/Dp had no effect on the levels of activated caspase (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>). Therefore, stimulation of growth and proliferation by <italic>pico</italic> is not associated with an increase in apoptosis, and <italic>pico</italic> is not capable of suppressing apoptosis induced by proliferative stimuli from E2F and DP oncogenes.</p>

        <title><italic>Pico</italic> Appears to Act in a Noncanonical EGFR-Dependent Pathway</title>
        <p>MRL proteins have been postulated to link activated growth factor receptors, such as the EGFR via interactions with Ras GTPases to changes in actin dynamics (<xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr">Krause et al., 2004</xref>). The <italic>Drosophila</italic> EGFR is critical for imaginal disc growth, as well as for patterning and differentiation (<xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">Diaz-Benjumea and Garcia-Bellido, 1990</xref>). Ectopic expression of dominant negative <italic>Egfr</italic> (<italic>Egfr<sup>DN</sup></italic>), which is thought to interfere with signaling by forming inactive heterodimers with the wild-type receptor (<xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr">Kashles et al., 1991</xref>), results in dramatically reduced, narrow wings and loss of wing veins (L3 and distal parts of L4 and L5) (<xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr">Guichard et al., 1999</xref>). Wings coexpressing <italic>pico</italic> and <italic>Egfr<sup>DN</sup></italic> resembled those expressing <italic>Egfr<sup>DN</sup></italic> alone (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref>A), indicating that <italic>pico</italic> failed to promote cell growth and proliferation when EGFR activity was compromised. This might indicate that <italic>pico</italic> is either upstream of <italic>Egfr</italic> or, alternatively, that <italic>pico</italic> needs to be activated by <italic>Egfr</italic> signaling to have its effect. Ectopic <italic>pico</italic> appeared to act cell autonomously, did not phenocopy <italic>Egfr</italic>-induced wing venation defects (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>), and did not affect EGFR levels or distribution (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figures 5</xref>B and 5C), suggesting that <italic>pico</italic> is unlikely to be upstream of <italic>Egfr</italic> or its ligands. Conversely, <italic>pico<sup>IR</sup></italic> suppressed the effect of <italic>Egfr</italic> overexpression on wing size, but not venation (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref>D), indicating that <italic>pico</italic> may be an effector of <italic>Egfr</italic>-mediated tissue growth.</p>
        <p>EGFR is known to activate Ras-like GTPases capable of binding to mammalian MRL proteins (<xref rid="bib25" ref-type="bibr">Rodriguez-Viciana et al., 2004</xref>). We found that full-length Pico and a fragment of Pico containing the RA-PH domain (Pico<sup>RA-PH</sup>) bound to constitutively activated Ras and Rap1 (Ras<sup>V12</sup> and Rap1<sup>V12</sup>, respectively) in the two-hybrid system. Pico did not bind to wild-type or dominant-negative Ras, suggesting that <italic>pico</italic> may be an effector of Ras GTPases (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref>E). In support of this, we found that ectopic <italic>pico<sup>IR</sup></italic> partially suppressed the effect of ectopic overexpression of <italic>Ras<sup>V12</sup></italic> in the wing (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref>F). In addition, wings overexpressing <italic>pico<sup>RA-PH</sup></italic> were significantly smaller than controls (89 ± 2.2%; p &lt; 0.01). This effect could be overcome by cooverexpression of full-length <italic>pico</italic> or enhanced by loss of one copy of <italic>pico</italic> (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figures 5</xref>G and 5H), suggesting that ectopic Pico<sup>RA-PH</sup> may interfere with pico function by competing for its binding partners, and that other regions of the pico protein are required for its growth-promoting effect. To determine whether <italic>pico</italic> contributes to canonical Ras effector signaling, we stained tissues ectopically expressing <italic>pico</italic> in flip-out clones with an antibody that recognizes the diphosphorylated (activated) form of MAPK (<xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr">Gabay et al., 1997</xref>). Ectopic <italic>pico</italic> had no detectable effect on activated MAPK staining relative to controls (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref>I). Taken together, these data suggest that <italic>pico</italic> acts downstream of EGFR and may act as a Ras or Rap1 effector, but does not induce the canonical MAPK pathway.</p>

        <title><italic>Pico</italic> Interacts with <italic>ena</italic> and Modifies Actin Dynamics</title>
        <p>Mammalian MRL proteins have been shown to stimulate F-actin formation without influencing total actin content (<xref rid="bib17 bib18" ref-type="bibr">Krause et al., 2004; Lafuente et al., 2004</xref>). We found that, in the context of the wing imaginal disc, ectopic <italic>pico</italic> promoted F-actin formation, and ectopic <italic>pico<sup>IR</sup></italic> reduced F-actin levels (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6</xref>A). Total actin content was unaffected in extracts (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6</xref>B), suggesting that <italic>pico</italic> regulates the ratio of G:F-actin content. <italic>Egfr<sup>DN</sup></italic> suppressed <italic>pico</italic>-mediated changes in G:F actin ratio (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figures 6</xref>B and 6C), suggesting that this aspect of <italic>pico</italic> function is dependent on EGFR signaling.</p>
        <p>MRL proteins alter actin dynamics through their interactions with proteins that can regulate the length and branching density of actin filaments, such as Ena/VASP (<xref rid="bib17 bib18" ref-type="bibr">Krause et al., 2004; Lafuente et al., 2004</xref>). MRL-Ena/VASP interactions are mediated by the Ena/VASP homology 1 domain (EVH1) domain in Ena/VASP. In support of this, we found that the EVH1 domain of <italic>Drosophila</italic> Ena bound directly to full-length Pico in the two-hybrid system, but not Pico<sup>RA-PH</sup>, which lacks canonical EVH1 binding sites (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6</xref>D). Endogenous, full-length Ena coimmunoprecipitated with Pico from <italic>Drosophila</italic> tissue extracts (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6</xref>E), suggesting that Ena is complexed to Pico in vivo.</p>
        <p>Given the conserved ability of Pico to bind Ena and promote F-actin formation, we tested the involvement of <italic>ena</italic> in <italic>pico</italic>-mediated F-actin accumulation and growth. For this analysis we used a mutant of <italic>ena</italic> (<italic>ena<sup>210</sup></italic>), which fails to interact with EVH1-binding partners (<xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr">Ahern-Djamali et al., 1998</xref>). Wings from <italic>ena<sup>210</sup></italic> heterozygotes resembled wild-type (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6</xref>F). <italic>ena<sup>210</sup></italic> dominantly suppressed <italic>pico</italic>-mediated F-actin accumulation (p &lt; 0.01, <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6</xref>A) and wing overgrowth (60%, p &lt; 0.01, <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6</xref>F), suggesting that <italic>ena</italic> is limiting for <italic>pico</italic> function. We also examined the effect of <italic>ena</italic> overexpression. Like ectopic <italic>pico</italic>, <italic>ena</italic> overexpression resulted in a decreased G:F actin ratio (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figures 6</xref>A and 6B) and significant wing overgrowth (p &lt; 0.01; <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6</xref>F). Wings coexpressing <italic>ena</italic> and <italic>pico<sup>IR</sup></italic> resembled those expressing <italic>pico<sup>IR</sup></italic> alone (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6</xref>F), indicating that <italic>ena</italic> is largely dependent on <italic>pico</italic> for its growth-promoting effect. Co-overexpression of <italic>ena</italic> and <italic>pico</italic> phenotypically resembled the effect of overexpressing either gene alone (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6</xref>F). The lack of an additive effect makes it unlikely that <italic>ena</italic> and <italic>pico</italic> act in parallel pathways to drive tissue overgrowth.

        <title>MRL Proteins Facilitate Mal/SRF Activation and Cell Proliferation</title>
        <p>The SRF is a mitogen-responsive transcription factor that is inhibited by binding of cellular G-actin to the SRF cofactor Mal (<xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr">Posern and Treisman, 2006</xref>). Ena/VASP has been reported to induce SRF activity via a region of Ena/VASP that mediates F-actin assembly (<xref rid="bib12 bib26" ref-type="bibr">Grosse et al., 2003; Sotiropoulos et al., 1999</xref>). Given that the MRL proteins share the ability to bind Ena/VASP and modify actin dynamics, we wondered whether Mal/SRF could be a conserved downstream target of the MRL proteins.</p>
        <p>First, we tested the ability of human Lpd to promote cell proliferation in HeLa cells, which only express Lpd and not RIAM. We generated three clonal Lpd knockdown HeLa cell lines using Lpd-specific or scrambled control short hairpin RNA (shRNA) expression. We quantified effects on cell proliferation by measurement of viable cell numbers using a tetrazolium dye (3-[4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl]-2,5-diphenyl tetrazolium bromide [MTT])-based metabolic assay. Knockdown of Lpd resulted in a reduction in cell proliferation (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figures 7</xref>A and 7B). Levels of apoptotic markers were not affected in Lpd knockdown cell lines (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figures 7</xref>C and 7D), indicating that reduction in cell number was not due to increased cell death. Importantly, there was no significant difference in proliferation of Lpd knockdown cell lines treated with or without EGF, unlike control cells, which overproliferated when treated with EGF (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7</xref>B). Taken together, these data suggest that Lpd is required for EGF-induced proliferation, and that the effect of <italic>pico</italic> on proliferation is conserved in human Lpd.</p>
        <p>Second, we used an established cell culture system (<xref rid="bib26" ref-type="bibr">Sotiropoulos et al., 1999</xref>) to analyze the effect of MRL proteins on SRF activity. Ectopic expression of pico induced a 7.2-fold increase in SRF-responsive gene expression (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7</xref>E), similar to the effect of activated H-Ras (H-RasV12). Lpd also appeared to increase SRF activation. The effect was much less pronounced than pico, most likely because there is tight negative regulation of ectopic Lpd expression in mammalian cells. However, the effect of Lpd was significantly enhanced in the presence of H-RasV12. The effect of Lpd and H-RasV12 co-overexpression was significantly higher than that of H-RasV12 alone (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7</xref>E). When we tested whether Lpd was required for SRF activation, we found that serum-induced SRF activation was abrogated in Lpd knockdown cell lines compared with control cell lines (p &lt; 0.05; <xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7</xref>F). These data show that MRL proteins are capable of inducing SRF activation, and that Lpd is required for efficient serum-induced SRF activation in mammalian cells.</p>
        <p>Finally, we examined the role of <italic>mal</italic> in <italic>pico</italic>-mediated overproliferation. Overexpression of wild-type or activated <italic>mal</italic> or <italic>blistered</italic> (<italic>bs</italic>), which encodes <italic>Drosophila</italic> SRF, has been previously reported to cause overproliferation of the adult wing (<xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr">Han et al., 2004</xref>), similar to the phenotype resulting from ectopic <italic>pico</italic>. We found that ectopic <italic>mal</italic> reduced cell-doubling time (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7</xref>G) without inducing apoptosis (as determined by activated caspase 3 staining; data not shown), and resulted in a significant increase in wing area (p &lt; 0.01; <xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7</xref>H). Co-overexpression of <italic>mal</italic> and <italic>pico</italic> in flies phenotypically resembled the effect of overexpressing <italic>mal</italic> alone. Furthermore, <italic>mal</italic>-mediated overgrowth could not be suppressed by ectopic <italic>pico<sup>IR</sup></italic> (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7</xref>I). <italic>Pico</italic>-mediated wing overgrowth was dominantly suppressed (47%; p &lt; 0.01) by a hypomorphic mutation in <italic>bs</italic> (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7</xref>J), indicating that <italic>bs</italic> is limiting for <italic>pico</italic>-mediated growth. Collectively, these data indicate that MRL proteins activate SRF-dependent gene expression and that <italic>mal</italic>/SRF mediate <italic>pico</italic>-induced tissue overgrowth.</p>

        <p>Here we show that <italic>pico</italic>, which encodes the only <italic>Drosophila</italic> member of the MRL family of proteins, and its mammalian ortholog, Lpd, have a conserved role in the regulation of cellular proliferation. Reduced <italic>pico</italic> or Lpd levels result in reduced rates of cellular proliferation, but do not impair cell survival. Too much <italic>pico</italic> promotes coordinated growth and proliferation, leading to larger tissues with more normal-sized cells. In this respect, the effect of <italic>pico</italic> is distinct from that of many known <italic>Drosophila</italic> growth drivers. Growth regulators, such as <italic>Drosophila</italic> S6K, cause cells to accumulate mass faster than they can divide, primarily due to effects on translation, leading to cellular hypertrophy. Other regulators, such as E2F, can drive cell division without stimulating cell growth, leading to hyperplastic cellular hypotrophy and/or apoptosis.</p>

        <title>MRL Proteins Link EGFR Activation to Changes in Actin Dynamics and Cellular Proliferation</title>
        <p>We found that attenuating EGFR signaling abrogates the effect of ectopic <italic>pico</italic> on both F-actin accumulation and tissue growth. <italic>pico</italic> acts cell autonomously and is therefore unlikely to act upstream of <italic>Egfr</italic> by affecting the level of EGFR ligands. To rule out that <italic>pico</italic> regulates levels of EGFR, we examined receptor levels and distribution in wing imaginal discs overexpressing <italic>pico</italic> or <italic>pico<sup>IR</sup></italic>. EGFR levels and distribution in these genetic backgrounds resembled wild-type. Another possibility is that <italic>pico</italic> regulates EGFR activity. Although suitable reagents were not available to directly monitor EGFR activity levels in wing discs, we analyzed effects on extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) activation, which provides a molecular readout for EGFR/Ras/Raf signaling. Diphosphorylated (dp) ERK levels were not affected by ectopic <italic>pico</italic>. These data suggest that, rather than being upstream of EGFR, Pico needs to be activated by EGFR or a downstream component of EGFR signaling, such as activated Ras. Consistently, both Lpd and Pico bind to activated, but not wild-type, Ras. Furthermore, we found that <italic>pico</italic> knockdown partially suppresses the effects of ectopic <italic>Egfr</italic> and activated <italic>Ras</italic>; in addition, Lpd knockdown impairs the EGF-induced increase in proliferation. Taken together, these data suggest that <italic>pico</italic> and Lpd are downstream effectors of EGFR.</p>
        <p>Ena/VASP has been reported to act downstream of MRL proteins (<xref rid="bib17 bib18" ref-type="bibr">Krause et al., 2004; Lafuente et al., 2004</xref>). Correspondingly, we found that <italic>pico</italic>-mediated wing overgrowth and F-actin accumulation are sensitive to the levels of <italic>ena</italic>. Importantly, <italic>ena</italic> is also sufficient to cause overgrowth and F-actin accumulation when overexpressed. Changes in actin dynamics induced by Ena/VASP proteins can activate SRF-dependent gene expression in mammalian cells. Similarly, we found that Pico and Lpd can activate SRF activity. Like <italic>pico</italic>, ectopic <italic>mal</italic> or <italic>bs</italic>/SRF in flies (<xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr">Han et al., 2004</xref>) are sufficient to cause wing overgrowth. <italic>Pico</italic>-mediated overgrowth is sensitive to the levels of <italic>bs</italic>/SRF, but <italic>mal</italic>-induced overgrowth could not be suppressed by <italic>pico</italic> knockdown, suggesting that Mal/SRF may act downstream of <italic>pico</italic> in flies. Collectively, these data suggest that MRL proteins may exert their mitogenic effects by specifically interacting with Ena/VASP proteins and inducing SRF-responsive transcription. Interactions between EGFR, MRL proteins, Ena/VASP, and Mal may provide a mechanism linking growth factor signaling and Mal-mediated SRF activation.</p>
        <p>Are MRL proteins uniquely able to stimulate Mal/SRF-mediated tissue growth? Although other actin regulators are known to activate Mal/SRF (<xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr">Posern and Treisman, 2006</xref>), there is currently little data to indicate that they play a role in proliferation control. This might be explained if different transcriptional responses occur at different Mal-dependent SRF activation thresholds, leading to diverse cellular outcomes. Alternatively, other actin regulators might influence processes that limit net tissue growth. For instance, Rho activates Mal/SRF in mammalian cells (<xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr">Posern and Treisman, 2006</xref>), but increased Rho activity in flies is associated with loss of epithelial integrity and cell extrusion (<xref rid="bib27" ref-type="bibr">Speck et al., 2003</xref>), which may negate any potential <italic>mal</italic>-mediated growth-promoting effects. These issues warrant further study in both flies and mammals. Future studies are also needed to characterize transcriptional targets of <italic>Drosophila</italic> SRF and resolve the contribution of SRF targets to MRL-mediated growth and proliferation.</p>

Single clones were selected in DMEM, 10% FBS, penicillin/streptomycin, 2 mM L-glutamine, 2 μg/ml puromycin, screened for Lpd expression/knockdown, and expanded. Proliferation of these cells lines was assessed in four independent experiments using the MTT cell proliferation assay (American Type Culture Collection) according to the manufacturer's instructions. For each experiment, cell lines were plated in triplicate and left growing in the absence or presence of 100 ng/ml EGF (Sigma Aldrich) for 5 days. The increase in proliferation compared to Day 1 was calculated, and cell lines expressing Lpd shRNA were compared to the control, which was set to 100%. The percentage of apoptosis in these cell lines was assessed using the Annexin-V-PE apoptosis detection kit (BD Biosciences). Flow cytometry was performed on a FACSCalibur cytometer (BD); 12,000 cells each were analyzed using the Cell Quest Pro software (BD).</p>

        <p>(A) Genomic organization of the <italic>pico</italic> locus. <italic>pico</italic> encodes two transcripts: <italic>pico</italic> and <italic>pico-L</italic>. Untranslated regions are shown in gray; coding regions are in green. Orientation of <italic>pico</italic> and <italic>CG11943</italic> transcription units is indicated with arrows. The insertion site of the <italic>P</italic>-element, <italic>GS9113</italic>, used to generate <italic>pico<sup>k1</sup></italic>, is marked. The deletion in <italic>pico<sup>k1</sup></italic> is indicated with a dashed line.</p>
        <p>(B) RT-PCR analysis showing reduction in levels of <italic>pico</italic> and <italic>pico-L</italic> expression in <italic>pico<sup>k1</sup></italic> mutant larvae.</p>
        <p>(C) Hemizygous <italic>pico<sup>k1</sup></italic> mutant larva to the left, showing arrested growth compared to <italic>pico</italic><sup>+</sup> siblings of the same age to the right. Inset: mutant larvae were identified on the basis that they lacked a GFP balancer chromosome.</p>
        <p>(D and E) <italic>pico</italic> mutant clones fail to divide and appear to be displaced from the wing imaginal disc epithelium. Compared to wild-type control clones (D), which are located in apical sections and contain, on average, about 45 positively marked cells, <italic>pico<sup>k1</sup></italic> mutant clones (E) contain, on average, fewer than five cells and appear to be located at the basal surface of the wing epithelium. Merged images show cells positively marked with GFP in green, DNA stained with propidium iodide in red, and F-actin labeled with phalloidin in blue.</p>

        <p>Knockdown of <italic>pico</italic> by RNAi Reduces Tissue Size</p>
        <p>Moderate ubiquitous expression of <italic>pico<sup>IR</sup></italic> results in a reduction in overall body size.</p>
        <p>(A and B) A <italic>tub-GAL4</italic> fly and a <italic>tub-GAL4 UAS-pico<sup>IR</sup></italic> (<italic>tub &gt; pico<sup>IR</sup></italic>) fly are shown for comparison. Quantitative measurements of female flies (n = 50 per genotype) show a 23% reduction in body weight in <italic>tub &gt; pico<sup>IR</sup></italic> flies (p &lt; 0.01).</p>
        <p>(C) Representative RT-PCR analysis showing reduction in <italic>pico</italic> and <italic>pico-L</italic> expression in <italic>tub-GAL4</italic> and <italic>UAS-pico<sup>IR</sup></italic> flies using primers recognizing both transcripts. A range of cDNA concentrations normalized against GAPDH was used to assess transcript levels.</p>
        <p>(D and E) Expression of <italic>pico<sup>IR</sup></italic> knocks down levels of Myc-tagged pico in wing imaginal discs. (D) High levels of ectopic pico in the posterior compartment marked by GFP (in green) were detected by Myc staining (in red) in <italic>en-GAL4</italic>, <italic>UAS-Myc-pico</italic> discs. (E) No Myc staining was detected in discs coexpressing <italic>pico<sup>IR</sup></italic>.</p>
        <p>(F and G) Compared with control (F), expression of two copies of <italic>pico<sup>IR</sup></italic> (G) results in a significant reduction in adult wing size (p &lt; 0.01). Male wings are shown. Wing area is expressed as a percentage of control (±SD). The reduction in wing size is due to fewer and smaller cells, as revealed by relative bristle density measurements (see insets).</p>
        <p>(H–J) Consequences of <italic>pico<sup>IR</sup></italic> overexpression in the posterior compartment of the wing under the control of <italic>en-GAL4</italic>. (H) Compared to control, expression of <italic>pico<sup>IR</sup></italic> with <italic>en-GAL4</italic> results in a reduction in size of the posterior compartment of the adult wing. A, anterior; P, posterior. Numerical scale is in arbitrary units. Error bars indicate 1 SD. (I and J) <italic>pico<sup>IR</sup></italic>-induced growth retardation is not due to aberrant cell cycle phasing. Flow cytometry was performed on dissociated wing disc cells overexpressing <italic>GFP</italic> alone (I) or <italic>pico<sup>IR</sup></italic> and <italic>GFP</italic> (J). GFP-positive experimental populations are marked in green; GFP-negative internal controls are marked in gray. Comparison of representative cell cycle profiles shows that <italic>pico<sup>IR</sup></italic> does not alter cell cycle phasing. Percentage of cells in G1, S, and G2 phases of the anterior and posterior compartments is shown in insets. Graphs of forward scatter (FSC; bottom panels) show that <italic>pico<sup>IR</sup></italic> results in a modest reduction in cell size at the third instar larval stage. The ratio of the mean FSC value of GFP-positive verses GFP-negative cells is shown in the top right corner of the bottom panels.</p>
        <p>(K and L) The distribution of clonal cell number for control (K) and <italic>pico<sup>IR</sup></italic>-expressing clones (L). Cell-doubling time (DT) is markedly increased by <italic>pico<sup>IR</sup></italic>. Insets show representative clones of each genotype as visualized by nuclear GFP.</p>

        <p>(B) Overexpression of <italic>pico</italic> in the developing wing pouch (<italic>MS1096</italic> &gt; <italic>pico/pico</italic>) results in significant wing overgrowth (p &lt; 0.01).

GFP-positive experimental populations are in green; GFP-negative internal controls are in gray. Comparison of representative cell cycle profiles shows that ectopic <italic>pico</italic> does not alter cell cycle phasing.

Graphs of forward scatter (FSC; bottom panels) show that cell size is relatively unaffected by ectopic <italic>pico</italic>. The ratio of the mean FSC value of GFP-positive verses GFP-negative cells is shown in the top right corner of the lower panels.</p>

        <p>Reduction or Elevation of <italic>pico</italic> Levels Does Not Induce Apoptosis</p>
        <p>The basal view of wing disc epithelia is shown. Discs expressing <italic>pico<sup>IR</sup></italic> with <italic>ptc-GAL4</italic> have a reduced zone of GFP-labeled cells compared with discs expressing GFP alone (control). Conversely, discs expressing ectopic <italic>pico</italic> displayed an expanded zone of GFP-labeled cells. Some cells were located basally, but did not show elevated caspase staining and did not have pyknotic nuclei (arrow). Expression of <italic>E2F</italic> and <italic>Dp</italic> resulted in high levels of caspase staining and nuclei were pyknotic (arrowhead). Coexpression of <italic>pico</italic> was unable to suppress <italic>E2F</italic>/<italic>Dp</italic>-induced cell death. Merged images show activated caspase staining in blue to visualize apoptotic cells, <italic>ptc-GAL4</italic>-expressing cells visualized by GFP in green, and propidium-labeled nuclei in red. All images were taken with identical settings to permit comparison of the intensity of activated caspase.</p>

        <p>(A) The effect of <italic>MS1096 &gt; pico</italic> is completely abrogated by coexpression of <italic>Egfr<sup>DN</sup></italic>. Wing area is expressed as a percentage of <italic>MS1096-GAL4</italic>-only control (±SD).</p>
        <p>(B) Ectopic <italic>pico</italic> does not affect EGFR distribution or levels in wing discs.</p>
        <p>(C) EGFR levels on immunoblots of wing disc extracts are unaffected by ectopic <italic>pico</italic>.</p>
        <p>(D) Wing overgrowth, but not aberrant wing venation, induced by ectopic <italic>Egfr</italic> is partially suppressed by co-overexpression of <italic>pico<sup>IR</sup></italic>.</p>
        <p>(E) Pico full-length and pico<sup>RA-PH</sup> bind Ras<sup>V12</sup> and Rap1<sup>V12</sup> in the yeast two-hybrid system, but not controls: wild-type Ras (Ras<sup>WT</sup>), dominant negative Ras (Ras<sup>DN</sup>), or an unrelated control (NIPP1). Interaction is indicated by blue X-gal coloration (X) and growth on auxotrophic media at high (H) and low (L) density.</p>
        <p>(F) The effect of overexpressing <italic>Ras<sup>V12</sup></italic> along the presumptive wing margin is partially suppressed by cooverexpression of <italic>pico<sup>IR</sup></italic>.</p>
        <p>(G and H) Reduced tissue growth resulting from ectopic expression of pico<sup>RA-PH</sup> can be (G) suppressed by co-overexpression of full-length <italic>pico</italic> or (H) enhanced in females by <italic>pico</italic> loss of function. Wing area is expressed as a percentage of <italic>MS1096-GAL4</italic> only control (±SD).</p>
        <p>(I) <italic>pico</italic> does not activate MAPK. Ectopic expression of <italic>pico<sup>IR</sup></italic> or <italic>pico</italic> in flip-out clones marked with GFP (in green) do not affect levels of activated MAPK (dpERK, in red), whereas ectopic <italic>Ras<sup>V12</sup></italic> leads to elevated levels of activated MAPK and rounded clones.</p>

        <p>(A) Representative wing discs of the indicated genotypes stained for F-actin. Ectopic expression of <italic>pico</italic> or <italic>ena</italic> results in elevated F-actin, whereas ectopic <italic>pico<sup>IR</sup></italic> reduces F-actin. <italic>pico</italic>-induced F-actin formation is dominantly suppressed by <italic>ena<sup>210</sup></italic>. Ectopic expression, driven by <italic>en-GAL4</italic>, is limited to the posterior compartment marked by GFP. Quantitation of ratios of anterior:posterior F-actin levels is shown at the bottom of (A) (±SD).</p>
        <p>(B) Immunoblots showing levels of total actin normalized to tubulin in extracts from wing discs of the indicated genotypes. Mean actin levels from six independent experiments are expressed below as percentage of the control ± SD.</p>
        <p>(C) Ectopic expression of <italic>Myc-pico</italic> using <italic>MS1096-GAL4</italic> results in elevated F-actin staining in the dorsal region of the wing disc where Myc-pico levels are highest. This effect is suppressed by coexpression of <italic>DN-Egfr</italic>. Quantitation of ratios of ventral:dorsal F-actin levels (±SD) is shown in the upper right corners of the upper panels.</p>
        <p>(D) Pico full-length, but not pico<sup>RA-PH</sup>, binds the Ena EVH1 domain, but not an unrelated control (NIPP1), in the yeast two-hybrid system. Interaction is indicated by blue X-gal (X) and growth on auxotrophic media at high (H) and low (L) density.</p>
        <p>(E) Ena coimmunoprecipitates with Myc-tagged pico from <italic>MS1096 &gt; Myc-pico</italic> wing disc extracts. Lower panel shows protein immunoblot analyses of total cell lysates to control for loading.</p>
        <p>(F) Wing images of the indicated genotypes showing functional interactions between <italic>pico</italic> and <italic>ena</italic> in the wing. Wing from <italic>ena<sup>210</sup></italic> heterozygote resembles wild-type. <italic>ena<sup>210</sup></italic> dominantly suppresses the effect of ectopic <italic>pico</italic> on tissue overgrowth; compare with the effect of one copy of <italic>pico</italic> alone. Ectopic <italic>ena</italic> drives tissue overgrowth. The effect of ectopic <italic>ena</italic> is not enhanced by coexpression of <italic>pico</italic>, but can be suppressed by one copy of <italic>pico<sup>IR</sup></italic>. The effect of one copy of <italic>pico<sup>IR</sup></italic> alone is shown for comparison. Mean wing area is expressed as a percentage of control (±SD).</p>

        <p>(A) Immunoblot analysis of Lpd expression in HeLa cell lines expressing Lpd-specific or scrambled shRNA. Hsc70 staining serves as loading control.</p>
        <p>(B) Lpd knockdown reduces cell proliferation and abrogates cell proliferation in response to EGF. Cell proliferation was measured using an MTT assay after 5 days. The increase in proliferation compared to Day 1 was calculated; the scrambled control with EGF was set to 100%. The mean values (±SEM) of four independent experiments are shown. <sup>∗∗</sup>p &lt; 0.05; <sup>#</sup>p &gt; 0.05; one-way ANOVA.</p>
        <p>(C and D) Lpd knockdown does not induce apoptosis. (C) Dot plots showing Annexin-V-PE/7-AAD staining of HeLa cell lines examined by flow cytometry. Camptothecin treatment (positive control, 20 μM for 24 hr) induced apoptosis. DMSO treatment acted as negative control. (D) Percentage of apoptotic cells as measured by Annexin-V staining for each of the indicated treatments. The mean values (±SEM) of three independent experiments are shown.</p>
        <p>(E and F) Transient expression of pico and coexpression of Lpd and HRasV12 significantly induce SRF-reporter gene activity in serum-starved 293FT cells. (E) Graph showing SRF activation for each of the indicated treatments, expressed as a percentage of the effect of constitutive active SRF (SRFVP16) activity.(F) Lpd knockdown abrogates serum-induced SRF activation. SRF activity is expressed as percentage relative to the serum-induced reporter activity in control cells. The mean values (±SEM) of three independent experiments are shown. <sup>∗∗</sup>Statistically significant results (p &lt; 0.05, one-way ANOVA).</p>
        <p>(G) The distribution of clonal cell number for control and <italic>mal</italic>-expressing clones. Cell-doubling time (DT) is markedly reduced by <italic>mal</italic>. Insets show representative clones of each genotype as visualized by nuclear GFP.</p>
        <p>(H) Overexpression of <italic>mal</italic> in the developing wing pouch (<italic>MS1096</italic> &gt; <italic>mal</italic>) results in significant wing overgrowth (p &lt; 0.01).</p>
        <p>(I) The effect of ectopic <italic>mal</italic> is not significantly modified by either coexpression of <italic>pico</italic> or <italic>pico<sup>IR</sup></italic>.</p>
        <p>(J) Wing from <italic>bs<sup>2</sup></italic> heterozygote resembling wild-type. <italic>bs<sup>2</sup></italic> dominantly suppresses the effect of ectopic <italic>pico</italic> on tissue overgrowth.</p>
