      <abstract>
        <p>Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) is characterized by left ventricular hypertrophy, increased ventricular stiffness and impaired diastolic filling. We investigated to what extent myocardial functional defects can be explained by alterations in the passive and active properties of human cardiac myofibrils. Skinned ventricular myocytes were prepared from patients with obstructive HCM (two patients with <italic>MYBPC3</italic> mutations, one with a <italic>MYH7</italic> mutation, and three with no mutation in either gene) and from four donors. Passive stiffness, viscous properties, and titin isoform expression were similar in HCM myocytes and donor myocytes. Maximal Ca<sup>2+</sup>-activated force was much lower in HCM myocytes (14 ± 1 kN/m<sup>2</sup>) than in donor myocytes (23 ± 3 kN/m<sup>2</sup>; <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.01), though cross-bridge kinetics (<italic>k</italic><sub>tr</sub>) during maximal Ca<sup>2</sup><sup>+</sup> activation were 10% faster in HCM myocytes. Myofibrillar Ca<sup>2</sup><sup>+</sup> sensitivity in HCM myocytes (pCa<sub>50</sub> = 6.40 ± 0.05) was higher than for donor myocytes (pCa<sub>50</sub> = 6.09 ± 0.02; <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.001) and was associated with reduced phosphorylation of troponin-I (ser-23/24) and MyBP-C (ser-282) in HCM myocytes. These characteristics were common to all six HCM patients and may therefore represent a secondary consequence of the known and unknown underlying genetic variants. Some HCM patients did however exhibit an altered relationship between force and cross-bridge kinetics at submaximal Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentrations, which may reflect the primary mutation. We conclude that the passive viscoelastic properties of the myocytes are unlikely to account for the increased stiffness of the HCM ventricle. However, the low maximum Ca<sup>2+</sup>-activated force and high Ca<sup>2+</sup> sensitivity of the myofilaments are likely to contribute substantially to any systolic and diastolic dysfunction, respectively, in hearts of HCM patients.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) is a genetically-determined disease that affects 1 in 500 people and which is characterized by ventricular hypertrophy, interstitial fibrosis, myocyte disarray and diastolic dysfunction <xref rid="bb0005" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>. Its clinical outcomes range from entirely asymptomatic disease to chronic progressive heart failure, arrhythmias and sudden cardiac death <xref rid="bb0010" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>. Molecular genetic studies have led to the concept of HCM as a disease of the sarcomere, since almost all of the known HCM disease genes encode sarcomeric proteins, in particular <italic>MYH7</italic> (which encodes β-myosin heavy chain, β-MyHC) and <italic>MYBPC3</italic> (encoding cardiac myosin binding protein-C, cMyBP-C), with each accounting for about one-third of the known HCM-associated mutations <xref rid="bb0005 bb0010 bb0015" ref-type="bibr">[1–3]</xref>. However, it remains the case that 40–60% of HCM patients screened appear to have no mutation in any sarcomeric protein so far implicated in HCM <xref rid="bb0020 bb0025" ref-type="bibr">[4,5]</xref>.</p>
      <p>The mechanisms linking myocardial dysfunction in human HCM, either directly or indirectly, with changes in sarcomeric proteins are unclear. The characteristic diastolic dysfunction (compromised myocardial relaxation and passive filling) is largely a consequence of increased ventricular stiffness, which may be due to the ventricular hypertrophy, disarray of myocytes, interstitial fibrosis, or possible myocardial ischaemia <xref rid="bb0015 bb0030" ref-type="bibr">[3,6]</xref>. However, there could also be an increased intrinsic stiffness of the myocytes. Myocyte passive stiffness is largely due to titin in the sarcomere <xref rid="bb0035 bb0040 bb0045" ref-type="bibr">[7–9]</xref> and an increase in the proportion of the stiffer (N2B) isoform of titin relative to the more compliant (N2BA) isoform was reported in an animal model of hypertrophy <xref rid="bb0050" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref> and in patients exhibiting diastolic heart failure with concentric LV hypertrophy <xref rid="bb0055" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>. In addition, myocyte viscoelasticity, which would contribute to the dynamic stiffness of the myocardium during chamber filling, was increased in pressure-overload hypertrophy in animal models <xref rid="bb0060" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>. However there has been no detailed investigation of the passive viscoelasticity of human myocytes to examine whether this may contribute to the increased stiffness of the HCM myocardium.</p>
      <p>Systolic performance too is often compromised in HCM, particularly during tachycardia. Cardiac output may be reduced by the impairment of diastolic filling. In addition, in approximately 25% of HCM patients there is upper septal hypertrophy associated with mitral valve dysfunction (systolic anterior motion), which obstructs the outflow tract (hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy, HOCM). It is not clear whether there are also changes in the contractile properties of myocytes that could either contribute to, or help to compensate for, the altered cardiac function in HCM. Results from studies with transgenic animals or isolated proteins have generally reported that HCM is associated with increased myofilament Ca<sup>2+</sup> sensitivity, with variable effects on maximum force or ATPase activity <xref rid="bb0065" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>, though a common (and perhaps unifying) feature is an increased energetic cost of contraction <xref rid="bb0070" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>. In the only previous study (to our knowledge) with myocytes from human HCM hearts, permeabilized (“skinned”) ventricular myocytes from patients with one of two truncation mutations in the <italic>MYBPC3</italic> gene showed a reduced maximum steady-state force production but elevated myofibrillar Ca<sup>2+</sup> sensitivity <xref rid="bb0075" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>. However, it was not clear whether these changes were specific to the two <italic>MYBPC3</italic> mutations studied or are a general characteristic of the myocardium in all HCM patients. Furthermore, cross-bridge cycling kinetics were not determined, so no inference could be made about the dynamics of myocardial contraction and relaxation in HCM.</p>
      <p>To investigate the role of the myocytes in determining the passive and active properties of the HCM myocardium, we examined in detail the steady-state and dynamic characteristics of passive stiffness and active force production in the myocytes from a representative group of HCM patients (with mutations in <italic>MYBPC3</italic>, <italic>MYH7</italic>, or neither gene), compared with myocytes from non-diseased hearts. By comparing results between individual patients, we explored whether the changes in contractile phenotype were gene-specific or were common to all the HCM patients. While passive viscoelasticity was not changed significantly, we found consistent alterations in the active properties of the HCM myocytes that likely contribute to the pathophysiology of the HCM myocardium. Most of these changes are likely to be secondary consequences of the disease process.</p>

      <title>Methods</title>
      <p>Methods were modified from those described previously <xref rid="bb0080" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>. Details are given in the online <xref rid="s0070" ref-type="sec">Data Supplement</xref>. In brief, hypertrophied tissue was obtained from septal tissue removed during surgical myectomy in HCM patients and donor tissue was obtained from the LV free wall of unused donor hearts <xref rid="bb0085" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>. All tissue samples were flash-frozen in liquid N<sub>2</sub>. It is unlikely that HCM patients are a homogeneous population (due to their different genotypes, drug treatments, co-morbidities, etc.), so we studied sufficient myocytes from each patient to allow comparison between individual patients.</p>
      <p>Mutation screening of the coding regions and splice sites of <italic>MYH7</italic> and <italic>MYBPC3</italic>, the predominant HCM-associated genes, was carried out <xref rid="bb0090" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>. Mutations were identified in patients M15 (<italic>MYBPC3</italic> T2604A+C deletion at 2605, predicted to encode a C-terminally truncated protein), MA (<italic>MYBPC3</italic> R502W), and ML (<italic>MYH7</italic> R719Q), but the other three HCM patients had no mutations in either gene.</p>
      <p>Single skinned myocytes were prepared from the frozen tissue, were glued between a force transducer and a motor (<xref rid="f0005" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>A) and set to a sarcomere length (SL) of 2.0 μm in relaxing solution at 15 °C. SL was measured by online video analysis. Myocyte passive viscoelasticity and its SL dependence were measured using step increases of cell length of 1 s duration (<xref rid="f0005" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>B). Each stretch induced a rapid rise in force to a peak, followed by a slower decay in force (stress relaxation) to reach a quasi-steady-state force (here termed “steady-state force”) after 1 s. Stress relaxation is due to the viscoelastic properties of the myocyte (i.e. of titin chiefly), while steady-state force is determined by its elastic properties <xref rid="bb0095" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>. Since the SL reached in each length step varied from myocyte to myocyte, we compared the force–SL extension curves of different myocytes in two ways. In the first (<xref rid="f0005" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>C), we used the measured force–SL relationship in each myocyte to estimate the force at SL = 2.3 μm by interpolation. This force was used as a measure of stiffness in each myocyte. In the second approach we grouped the values of SL reached in all myocytes during the length step into bins of 0.1 μm wide; this was used to determine the mean force–SL relationship and the parameters of stress relaxation (<xref rid="f0010" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>).</p>
      <p>Ca<sup>2+</sup>-activated force and the rate constant of force redevelopment (<italic>k</italic><sub>tr</sub>) were determined during maintained Ca<sup>2+</sup> activation of the myocytes. The <italic>k</italic><sub>tr</sub> value is an indirect measure of cross-bridge cycling kinetics that reflects the rate of cross-bridge reattachment and transition to the force-generating state(s) <xref rid="bb0100" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>. The activated myocyte was subjected to a rapid release/restretch protocol and <italic>k</italic><sub>tr</sub> was determined from a single exponential fit to the force redevelopment trace. Maximal force was normalized to myocyte cross-sectional area.</p>
      <p>Force and <italic>k</italic><sub>tr</sub> data were averaged from 3–10 myocytes from each heart and this mean value was taken as a single datum point for the calculation of the overall means. Unless stated otherwise, data points show mean ± SE for tissue from <italic>n</italic> = 4 donor hearts and <italic>n</italic> = 6 HCM hearts.</p>

        <title>Passive stiffness and stress relaxation</title>
        <p>Passive force was compared in skinned human donor and HCM myectomy myocytes that were subject to a series of step stretches (<xref rid="f0005" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>B). From the resulting force–SL relationship for each myocyte (e.g. <xref rid="f0005" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>C) we estimated the peak and steady-state forces at 2.3 μm. <xref rid="f0005" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>D shows the results for steady-state force in individual cells from each donor and HCM patient. There was some variability between myocytes taken from the same patient. Two myocytes had atypically high stiffness, possibly due to adherent collagen (see later) and were excluded from further analysis. The mean data (<xref rid="f0005" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>E) showed no significant difference between the stiffness of HCM and donor myocytes, whether measured from peak force or steady-state force.</p>
        <p>To examine the SL dependence of the time-independent (elastic) and time-dependent (viscoelastic) components of the force response, we grouped the SL values reached during the length steps into 0.1-μm-wide bins (<xref rid="f0010" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>). The resulting force–SL relationships confirmed that the steady-state force increase was the same in HCM and donors over the entire SL range, although there was a (non-significant) tendency for peak force to be higher in the HCM than donor myocytes at SLs &gt; 2.15 μm. The viscoelastic properties of the myocytes were assessed from the rate and extent of stress relaxation during the 1 s length step. Viscoelastic behavior caused passive force to fall by 40% during this step (<xref rid="f0010" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>B). The half-time (<italic>t</italic><sub>50</sub>) and relative magnitude of stress relaxation were found to be independent of SL and were not significantly different between donor and HCM myocytes (<xref rid="f0010" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>B and C), although there was a trend for <italic>t</italic><sub>50</sub> to be smaller (faster stress relaxation) in HCM myocytes. We conclude that myocyte viscoelastic properties were not altered significantly in the HCM myocytes.</p>
        <p>Titin is the major determinant of the passive viscoelasticity of myocytes <xref rid="bb0035 bb0040 bb0045" ref-type="bibr">[7–9]</xref>. Titin protein isoform expression in the human donor and HCM myocardium was therefore analyzed (<xref rid="s0070" ref-type="sec">Supplementary Data</xref>). As found previously, human tissue contained both the N2B and N2BA isoforms. The relative proportion of N2B (the shorter, stiffer isoform) was not significantly different in HCM and donor myocardium (69 ± 2%, <italic>n</italic> = 6 and 61 ± 2%, <italic>n</italic> = 4, respectively). There was also no difference between HCM and donor myocardium in terms of titin degradation, measured by the T2 band density relative to total titin (20 ± 5% in HCM vs. 23 ± 5% in donor) and total titin protein, expressed relative to the total expression of MyHC protein (0.53 ± 0.02 vs. 0.47 ± 0.02, <italic>P</italic> = 0.93).</p>

Myocytes from donor N8 exhibited a smaller force than the other donors but we found no other functional or biochemical differences in N8 compared with the other donors, so this sample was included in the calculation of mean force (<xref rid="f0015" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>B); without this inclusion, the difference in maximum force between HCM and donor myocytes would have been even greater.</p>
        <p>We investigated possible reasons for this large loss of force in HCM myocytes compared with donor myocytes. One possibility was that the kinetics of cross-bridge cycling were altered substantially, e.g. force would be reduced if attachment of cross-bridges to actin were slower, or the detachment faster. To assess cross-bridge kinetics, we measured the rate of force redevelopment (<italic>k</italic><sub>tr</sub>) after forced detachment of the cross-bridges. The <italic>k</italic><sub>tr</sub> values at pCa 4.5 were consistent within individual patients (<xref rid="f0015" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>C) and were 10% faster in HCM myocytes than in donor myocytes (<xref rid="f0015" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>D). The force and <italic>k</italic><sub>tr</sub> data are consistent with a faster cross-bridge detachment, rather than slower attachment, in HCM myocytes (see <xref rid="s0045" ref-type="sec">Discussion</xref>).</p>

        <title>Structure of myocytes</title>
        <p>Another possible reason for the reduced force was disruption or loss of myofibrils in HCM myocytes. Videomicroscopy of skinned myocytes (<xref rid="f0020" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref>A) revealed a somewhat distorted striation pattern in HCM myocytes and a slightly shorter resting SL (1.73 ± 0.01 μm) than in donor myocytes (1.78 ± 0.01 μm; <italic>n</italic> = 4, 21 myocytes each; <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.001). Confocal microscopy (<xref rid="f0020" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref>B) confirmed the slight disorder of the sarcomeres in HCM myocytes. However, staining with antibodies against titin or sarcomeric α-actinin provided no evidence for fewer myofibrils in the HCM myocytes, although precise quantitative studies could not be carried out. This suggests that the large reduction of maximum force could not be explained by loss of myofibrils.</p>
        <p>Interestingly, in the donor samples collagen IV fibers were often associated intimately with the myocytes and exhibited a partially striated pattern at the level of the Z-disc, reflecting the arrangement of costameres (arrowheads, <xref rid="f0020" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref>B, panels e and f). It is possible that similar collagen, running along the length of the myocyte, may have accounted for the abnormally high stiffness seen in some myocytes in <xref rid="f0005" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>D. Although there was generally more collagen IV in the HCM myocytes, this tended to be found in clumps and the association with costameric structures was much less pronounced than in donor myocytes.</p>

        <title>Ca<sup>2+</sup> sensitivity of force and cross-bridge cycling kinetics</title>
        <p>In intact cardiac myocytes the Ca<sup>2+</sup> transient does not activate the myofibrils fully, so it is essential to determine myofibrillar properties at submaximal levels of activation. The Ca<sup>2+</sup> sensitivity was consistently higher for the HCM skinned myocytes than for the donors, as shown by the average force–pCa curves (<xref rid="f0025" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref>A) and the individual pCa<sub>50</sub> values (<xref rid="f0025" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref>B). The mean pCa<sub>50</sub> values were 6.40 ± 0.05 (<italic>n</italic> = 6) for HCM myocytes and 6.09 ± 0.02 (<italic>n</italic> = 4) for donor (<italic>P</italic> = 0.001), while the steepness of the force–pCa relationship was unchanged (<italic>n</italic><sub><italic>H</italic></sub> values of 3.73 ± 0.56 and 2.95 ± 0.12, respectively; <italic>P</italic> &gt; 0.05). This increase in Ca<sup>2+</sup> sensitivity causes the inhibitory effect of the reduced maximum force to be overcome for pCa values above ~ 6.2 (dashed line, <xref rid="f0025" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref>A).</p>
        <p>Myofibrillar Ca<sup>2+</sup> sensitivity is influenced by protein kinase A (PKA)-mediated phosphorylation of troponin-I and possibly MyBP-C. Analysis using phosphorylation-specific antibodies revealed that phosphorylation of TnI (ser-23/24) sites and of MyBP-C (ser282) were significantly lower in HCM myocardium than in donor myocytes (<xref rid="f0025" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref>C and D). To investigate whether the lower phosphorylation could account for the higher Ca<sup>2+</sup> sensitivity of the HCM myocytes, we compared the Ca<sup>2+</sup>-shortening relationships in skinned, unattached myocytes with and without incubation in PKA. With HCM myocytes, PKA phosphorylated TnI and MyBP-C (see <xref rid="s0070" ref-type="sec">Data Supplement</xref>) and decreased myofibrillar Ca<sup>2+</sup> sensitivity (<xref rid="f0025" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref>E), whereas with donor myocytes there was little change in phosphorylation or myofibrillar Ca<sup>2+</sup> sensitivity, leading to the difference in Ca<sup>2+</sup> sensitivity between the HCM and donor myocytes being reduced by about one-half. Thus the differing Ca<sup>2+</sup> sensitivity of the myocytes under basal conditions was partly due to differences in phosphorylation at PKA sites.</p>
        <p><xref rid="f0030" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6</xref> shows how both cross-bridge kinetics (<italic>k</italic><sub>tr</sub>) and force (i.e. the level of thin filament activation) changed as the bathing Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentration was altered. As found previously with human myofibrils <xref rid="bb0080" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>, <italic>k</italic><sub>tr</sub> increased as [Ca<sup>2+</sup>] (and force) was raised, and this was true for both donor and HCM myocytes. The <italic>k</italic><sub>tr</sub>–force relationships for the HCM patients at submaximal Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentrations were generally similar to those for donor myocytes. However, patient M15 noticeably showed greater <italic>k</italic><sub>tr</sub> values at submaximal force levels (i.e. faster cross-bridge kinetics for a given level of thin filament activation), whereas patient MM tended to have the slowest kinetics. Overall, there was no consistent difference between the Ca<sup>2+</sup> regulation of cross-bridge kinetics between HCM and donor patients.</p>

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>This study is the first to examine both the steady-state and dynamic properties of passive viscoelasticity and Ca<sup>2+</sup>-activated contractions in skinned myocytes from patients with obstructive HCM, although van Dijk et al. <xref rid="bb0075" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref> have previously reported steady-state force measurements in myocytes from a set of HCM patients with truncation mutations in the <italic>MYBPC3</italic> gene. Our HCM unselected cohort contained two patients with mutations in <italic>MYBPC3</italic>, one with a mutation in <italic>MYH7</italic>, and three with no mutation in either gene. These ratios are representative of HCM patients in general, in whom mutations in <italic>MYBPC3</italic> and <italic>MYH7</italic> have been found in 16–26% and 14–19%, respectively, of patients, while 40–60% of patients had no mutation in the genes for the main sarcomeric proteins <xref rid="bb0020 bb0025" ref-type="bibr">[4,5]</xref>. Furthermore, we obtained sufficient data from individual patients to allow us to compare between them, in order to examine whether the changes we observed were specific to the particular <italic>MYBPC3</italic> or <italic>MYH7</italic> mutation, or were common to all the HCM patients. We found the passive elastic and viscous properties of the HCM myocytes were similar between patients and were not significantly different from those of donor myocytes. In contrast, the maximum Ca<sup>2+</sup>-activated force of myocytes from HCM patients was decreased by 40% compared with donor myocytes, while the Ca<sup>2+</sup> sensitivity of force production was substantially greater. These functional changes, which could adversely affect both diastolic and systolic function, were seen in all our HCM patients, suggesting they are secondary consequences of the underlying genetic differences between patients. However there was some evidence that differences between the HCM patients could be revealed by cross-bridge cycling kinetics at submaximal Ca<sup>2+</sup> activation.</p>

        <title>Myocyte viscoelasticity</title>
        <p>While measurements <italic>in vivo</italic> have shown an increase in chamber stiffness in the hypertrophied heart <xref rid="bb0105" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>, it is not known whether this is due in part to changes in the passive properties of the myocytes. During diastolic filling myocyte length increases continuously, so the passive stiffness of the myocytes during this period depends upon both their elasticity (length-dependent) and viscoelasticity (velocity-dependent). Previous studies have reported that pressure-overload hypertrophy in animals and humans is associated with increased myocyte stiffness resulting from an increased titin N2B:N2BA ratio <xref rid="bb0050 bb0055" ref-type="bibr">[10,11]</xref> or with increased myocyte viscosity resulting from microtubule proliferation <xref rid="bb0060" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>. Our results demonstrate that passive stiffness and viscosity were not significantly different between HCM and donor myocytes (<xref rid="f0005 f0010" ref-type="fig">Figs. 1 and 2</xref>). The passive viscoelastic behavior of the myocyte is thought to be due to the unfolding of titin's globular domains <xref rid="bb0045" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref> and to titin's interactions with actin <xref rid="bb0110" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>. Consistent with the functional data, there was no significant difference in the titin N2B/N2BA isoform ratio between HCM and donor myocytes. Thus the myocytes from our HCM patients exhibited no enhancement of dynamic or static stiffness that could contribute to the increased diastolic stiffness characteristic of hypertrophied myocardium. This contrasts with other studies with ischemic or dilated cardiomyopathy, in which changes in stiffness and the titin isoform ratio were reported to either cause, or compensate for, changes in the elastic component of tissue stiffness <xref rid="bb0115" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>. We conclude that the higher stiffness of the HCM myocardium is due to factors other than myocyte viscoelasticity, such as the disarray of myocytes and increased tissue fibrosis <xref rid="bb0030" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>.</p>

        <title>Maximum force production</title>
        <p>A major difference in the active properties of the HCM and donor myocytes was found with maximum Ca<sup>2+</sup>-activated force, which was decreased by about 40% in HCM compared with donor myocytes (<xref rid="f0015" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>). The large loss of force-producing capacity can account for the smaller contraction of intact myocytes from similar myectomy samples <xref rid="bb0085" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref> and would tend to cause systolic dysfunction in the intact heart.</p>
        <p>We found no change in protein content of the myofibrils that could explain this large loss of force. Although there was no evidence for a loss of myofibrils (<xref rid="f0020" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref>), HCM myocytes did have a somewhat less organized sarcomere alignment than donor myocytes. Depending on the precise derangements at the molecular level, this might cause a loss of force, though further work is needed to explore this. Another possibility is that the decrease in maximal force was due to a reduction in the number of attached, force-producing cross-bridges per sarcomere, caused by either a smaller rate of cross-bridge attachment and transition to force-producing states (<italic>f</italic><sub>app</sub>) or a greater rate of detachment (<italic>g</italic><sub>app</sub>). Maximum <italic>k</italic><sub>tr</sub> (which is ∝ <italic>f</italic><sub>app</sub> + <italic>g</italic><sub>app</sub>) <xref rid="bb0100" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref> was ~ 10% faster in HCM myocytes (<xref rid="f0015" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>D), which is not consistent with a slower <italic>f</italic><sub>app</sub>. A faster <italic>g</italic><sub>app</sub> would however both increase <italic>k</italic><sub>tr</sub> and decrease force. If we assume that 50% of cross-bridges (∝ <italic>f</italic><sub>app</sub>/[<italic>f</italic><sub>app</sub> + <italic>g</italic><sub>app</sub>]) are attached at maximal Ca<sup>2+</sup> (so <italic>f</italic><sub>app</sub> = <italic>g</italic><sub>app</sub>), then the 10% increase in <italic>k</italic><sub>tr</sub> could be caused by a 20% increase in <italic>g</italic><sub>app</sub>, which would lower force by 9%. Thus a faster <italic>g</italic><sub>app</sub> could explain some of the reduced force in HCM myocytes but there must be additional factors, such as fewer cycling cross-bridges or a decrease in the force produced per cross-bridge. Using myosin isolated from myectomies similar to ours, in an <italic>in vitro</italic> motility assay the fraction of filaments motile was reduced by 19% <xref rid="bb0085" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>, which suggested a fall in the population of active myosins due to alterations in myosin itself; a similar fall in the number of active cross-bridges would contribute substantially to the decrease in force observed here.</p>
        <p>An important question is whether the decrease in maximum force is directly due to the mutations in the HCM patients, or to secondary changes. This question cannot be answered definitively with human studies, since human tissue is necessarily obtained only during surgery on patients who are already symptomatic and in whom any primary defect has likely caused many secondary changes. Nevertheless, our finding (<xref rid="f0015" ref-type="fig">Figs. 3</xref> and <xref rid="f0025" ref-type="fig">5</xref>) that a similar contractile phenotype is seen in myocytes from six unrelated HCM patients (with different mutations in <italic>MYBPC3</italic> or <italic>MYH7</italic>, or neither of these), measured under identical conditions, suggests that the contractile deficiency is a common consequence of HCM, secondary to the initial abnormalities produced by the known and unknown genetic variant(s) underlying the cardiomyopathy <xref rid="bb0085" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>. By analogy, we suggest that similar secondary changes may account for the reduced maximum force production observed in HCM myocytes with another <italic>MYBPC3</italic> mutation <xref rid="bb0075" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref> or in HCM myofibrils with the <italic>MYH7</italic> R403Q mutation <xref rid="bb0120" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>.</p>

        <title>Myofibrillar Ca<sup>2+</sup> sensitivity</title>
        <p>HCM myocytes were more Ca<sup>2+</sup>-sensitive than donor myocytes, with pCa<sub>50</sub> elevated by 0.31 units, corresponding to a 50% reduction in the [Ca<sup>2+</sup>] required for half-maximal activation of force (<xref rid="f0025" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref>). This disparity was due, at least in part, to the very low levels of phosphorylation in TnI at ser-23/24 sites and MyBP-C at ser-282 (<xref rid="f0025" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref>C and D), since the difference in Ca<sup>2+</sup> sensitivity was much reduced after incubation in PKA (<xref rid="f0025" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref>E). Whether the difference remaining after PKA reflects a primary influence of an underlying mutation, as has been found in animal models of HCM <xref rid="bb0065" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>, remains to be established. Our results differ somewhat from those of van Dijk et al. <xref rid="bb0075" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>, who reported a reduction in TnI phosphorylation but unchanged MyBP-C phosphorylation in HCM patients with truncation mutations in <italic>MYBPC3</italic>. van Dijk et al. suggested that the contractile dysfunction might be caused by the differential phosphorylation of TnI and MyBP-C, but this explanation is unlikely to apply to our patients, who exhibited reduced phosphorylation of both TnI and MyBP-C.</p>
        <p>One caveat with all studies like these is that the phosphorylation status of the biopsies may be influenced by the drug treatment of the patients immediately prior to biopsy retrieval. In particular, the donor hearts may show elevated phosphorylation due to inotropic drug support prior to cardiac explantation <xref rid="bb0125" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>, which may exaggerate the difference in Ca<sup>2+</sup> sensitivity observed here. Nevertheless, it seems likely that the high Ca<sup>2+</sup> sensitivity observed with HCM myocytes reflects the situation <italic>in vivo.</italic> This elevated Ca<sup>2+</sup> sensitivity would tend to maintain contractile strength in the face of the reduced contractility (dashed line, <xref rid="f0025" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref>A), which may help explain why systolic function may not be compromised in HCM patients. On the other hand, this increase in Ca<sup>2+</sup>-responsiveness would, by causing a large relative enhancement of force at Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentrations just above threshold (<xref rid="f0025" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref>A), tend to slow ventricular relaxation and enhance diastolic stiffness in intact myocytes. This myofilament-based factor could thus contribute to poor diastolic function of the HCM myocardium <italic>in vivo</italic>. Finally, a raised Ca<sup>2+</sup> sensitivity may increase the risk of arrhythmias <xref rid="bb0130" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>, which is a characteristic feature of HCM.</p>

        <title>Cross-bridge kinetics</title>
        <p>The cycling rate of activated cross-bridges is a major determinant of the kinetics of force development and relaxation in the myocardium <xref rid="bb0135" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>, and is therefore a key factor regulating the contractility of the heart. Cross-bridge cycling kinetics (<italic>k</italic><sub>tr</sub>) during maximal Ca<sup>2</sup><sup>+</sup> activation were 10% faster in HCM myocytes than in donors (<xref rid="f0015" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>D). This distinguishes the contractile phenotype from end-stage heart failure, where the cross-bridges are usually slower than normal, due to a decrease in the α:β MyHC isoform ratio <xref rid="bb0140" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref>. It has been shown that re-expression of atrial light chain-1 (ALC-1) in hypertrophied ventricular myocardium is associated with a faster <italic>k</italic><sub>tr</sub> <xref rid="bb0145" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref>. While we did not detect expression of ALC-1 in our HCM biopsies using 1-D gels, increased ALC-1 expression was detected in similar HCM biopsies using 2-D gels <xref rid="bb0085" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>, so this is a possible cause of the faster maximum cross-bridge cycling kinetics in our experiments.</p>
        <p>More appropriate for the intact heart are cross-bridge kinetics under the physiologically relevant conditions of submaximal Ca<sup>2+</sup> activation (<xref rid="f0030" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6</xref>). In most HCM patients the relative force–<italic>k</italic><sub>tr</sub> relationship was similar to donors, implying no inherent change in the Ca<sup>2+</sup> regulation of cross-bridge cycling kinetics. (Note that for the analysis in Fig. 6 we assume that the observed reduction in maximum Ca<sup>2+</sup> activated force is due to fewer active cross-bridges, with no change in force per attached cross-bridge). However, patient M15 exhibited submaximal <italic>k</italic><sub>tr</sub> values above those for the other human samples. Interestingly, this mutation (<italic>MYBPC3</italic> T2604A+C deletion at 2605) encodes for a C-terminally truncated cMyBP-C that leads to a 35% reduction of cMyBP-C content in this patient <xref rid="bb0090" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>. There is evidence that cMyBP-C functions as a phosphorylation-sensitive “brake” on cross-bridge movement towards the thin filament, because cross-bridge cycling is increased by phosphorylation of cMyBP-C or by the absence of cMyBP-C in KO mice <xref rid="bb0150" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref>. It therefore possible that the faster cross-bridge kinetics in M15 results from the MyBP-C haploinsufficiency in this patient. There was no clear acceleration of kinetics with the other <italic>MYBPC3</italic> mutation, but this patient (MA) has a missense mutation that is associated with a much smaller (17%) reduction in cMyBP-C than with patient M15 <xref rid="bb0090" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>.</p>
        <p>The third mutation we found (<italic>MYH7</italic> R719Q) was in patient ML. This mutation has previously been shown to reduce sliding velocity in a motility assay with <italic>Dictyostelium</italic> myosin <xref rid="bb0155" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref> or increase it in human slow muscle fibers <xref rid="bb0160" ref-type="bibr">[32]</xref>. We found that this mutation led to no obvious alteration in isometric cross-bridge cycling kinetics at physiological levels of Ca<sup>2+</sup> activation. Thus findings from model systems should be extrapolated to the human myocardium with care.</p>
        <p>It should be noted that our kinetic data do not confirm or refute the concept that HCM is associated with inefficient ATP utilization by the myofilaments <xref rid="bb0070" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>. In some of our HCM samples the cross-bridge kinetics at submaximal Ca<sup>2+</sup> activation tended to be faster than in donors and in some they tended to be slower. However simultaneous measurements of ATPase activity and force would be required to directly assess efficiency of chemomechanical transduction in these patients.</p>
        <p>In summary, this study reports the static and dynamic properties of skinned myocytes from a representative group of patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. Myocyte passive properties were no different in HCM and donor myocytes, which suggests that other factors are responsible for the increased stiffness of the intact ventricle. HCM myocytes exhibited a large decrease in maximum Ca<sup>2+</sup> activated force, which if representative of myocytes in the intact myocardium, would tend to cause systolic dysfunction. Counteracting this would be the enhanced myofibrillar Ca<sup>2+</sup> sensitivity in HCM myocytes, but this factor would tend to slow relaxation and contribute to diastolic dysfunction in the intact heart. Thus the properties of the myocytes likely contribute to both the systolic and diastolic contractile dysfunction of the HCM heart.</p>
