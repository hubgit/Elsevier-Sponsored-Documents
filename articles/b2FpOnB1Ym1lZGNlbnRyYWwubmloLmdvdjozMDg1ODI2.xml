      <abstract>
        <p><italic>Dictyostelium</italic> is the only non-metazoan with functionally analyzed SH2 domains and studying them can give insights into their evolution and wider potential. LrrB has a novel domain configuration with leucine-rich repeat, 14-3-3 and SH2 protein–protein interaction modules. It is required for the correct expression of several specific genes in early development and here we characterize its role in later, multicellular development. During development in the light, slug formation in LrrB null (lrrB-) mutants is delayed relative to the parental strain, and the slugs are highly defective in phototaxis and thermotaxis. In the dark the mutant arrests development as an elongated mound, in a hitherto unreported process we term dark stalling. The developmental and phototaxis defects are cell autonomous and marker analysis shows that the pstO prestalk sub-region of the slug is aberrant in the lrrB- mutant. Expression profiling, by parallel micro-array and deep RNA sequence analyses, reveals many other alterations in prestalk-specific gene expression in lrrB- slugs, including reduced expression of the <italic>ecmB</italic> gene and elevated expression of <italic>ampA</italic>. During culmination <italic>ampA</italic> is ectopically expressed in the stalk, there is no expression of <italic>ampA</italic> and <italic>ecmB</italic> in the lower cup and the mutant fruiting bodies lack a basal disc. The basal disc cup derives from the pstB cells and this population is greatly reduced in the lrrB- mutant. This anatomical feature is a hallmark of mutants aberrant in signaling by DIF-1, the polyketide that induces prestalk and stalk cell differentiation. In a DIF-1 induction assay the lrrB- mutant is profoundly defective in <italic>ecmB</italic> activation but only marginally defective in <italic>ecmA</italic> induction. Thus the mutation partially uncouples these two inductive events. In early development LrrB interacts physically and functionally with CldA, another SH2 domain containing protein. However, the CldA null mutant does not phenocopy the lrrB- in its aberrant multicellular development or phototaxis defect, implying that the early and late functions of LrrB are affected in different ways. These observations, coupled with its domain structure, suggest that LrrB is an SH2 adaptor protein active in diverse developmental signaling pathways.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>SH2 domains mediate the tyrosine phosphorylation-dependent formation of protein complexes in many cellular and developmental signaling pathways (<xref rid="bb0180" ref-type="bibr">Pawson et al., 2001</xref>). Almost all of those described are found in animals, which typically encode over a hundred SH2 domain proteins (<xref rid="bb0155" ref-type="bibr">Liu et al., 2006</xref>), but the amoebozoan <italic>Dictyostelium</italic> possesses a small functionally diverse contingent of thirteen SH2 domain proteins (<xref rid="bb0055" ref-type="bibr">Eichinger et al., 2005</xref>). The family includes four STAT proteins, five kinases, an ortholog of the Cbl proto-oncogene and an F-box protein. Based upon their domain structure the latter two proteins, CblA and FbxB, are assumed to target other proteins for degradation (<xref rid="bb0150" ref-type="bibr">Langenick et al., 2008</xref>). The remaining two SH2 domain proteins, CldA and LrrB, respectively contain a Clu domain and a leucine-rich repeat domain (<xref rid="bb0210" ref-type="bibr">Sugden et al., 2010</xref>).</p>
      <p>The Clu domain is a relatively large, &gt; 200aa, domain of unknown function. The founding family member was <italic>Dictyostelium</italic> CluA, a highly conserved protein that is essential for the maintenance of mitochondrial spacing (<xref rid="bb0070 bb0065 bb0250" ref-type="bibr">Fields et al., 2002; Fields et al., 1998; Zhu et al., 1997</xref>). Leucine-rich repeats are protein–protein interaction domains and LrrB also contains a functional binding site for 14-3-3, another regulatable protein–protein interaction site (<xref rid="bb0160" ref-type="bibr">Mackintosh, 2004</xref>). The presence in LrrB of three protein–protein interaction modules and the absence of any other recognizable domains suggest that, like CblA and FbxB, LrrB serves as an adaptor. Consistent with this, LrrB interacts with CldA and this binding depends upon an intact LrrB SH2 domain and is markedly increased when pervanadate is used to generate a high cellular level of tyrosine phosphorylation by inhibiting tyrosine dephosphorylation.</p>
      <p>The <italic>lrrB</italic> gene is expressed semi-constitutively, during cell growth and throughout development, but a null mutant shows no outward defect in growth and early development (<xref rid="bb0210" ref-type="bibr">Sugden et al., 2010</xref>). However, expression-profiling, using a genome-wide microarray, revealed large (respectively 7, 44 and 49-fold) decreases in the abundance of just three mRNA sequences: encoding TtdA (a metallo-hydrolase), CinB (an esterase) and AbcG10 (an ABC transporter). There was also an increase in the abundance of the discoidin1 lectin mRNAs. The phenotypic significance of these changes and the mechanism generating them are unknown, but they were used to confirm a functional interaction between CldA and LrrB — by showing that the two genes most highly under-expressed in the lrrB- strain, cinB and abcG10, are also under-expressed in a <italic>cldA</italic> null strain. Thus there are very specific, but outwardly silent, defects in the early development of the lrrB- strain. Here we analyze the late phenotypes of the null mutation and show that the mutant has more frequent but less extreme aberrations in individual gene expression. There are also marked morphological defects and aberrations in slug behavior, structure and terminal development in the lrrB- mutant that seem likely to relate to defects in prestalk differentiation.</p>
      <p>During normal development cells aggregate together and pile up to form a mound. Cells within the mound differentiate as either prestalk or prespore cells. Many of the prestalk cells move to the apex of the mound but a significant proportion, the anterior-like cells (ALC), remains in the prespore zone. The mound elongates to form a standing slug that either enters culmination immediately or falls onto its side and migrates away. The migratory slug is sensitive to light and temperature gradients and these sensitivities direct it to an appropriate microenvironment for culmination and spore release. There are multiple prestalk and ALC subtypes that can be distinguished, using molecular markers and by their anatomical positions and patterns of movement (<xref rid="bb0110" ref-type="bibr">Gaudet et al., 2008</xref>). The subtypes also differ in the extracellular signals that induce them.</p>
      <p>DIF-1 is a chlorinated hexaphenone that is produced by the prespore cells (<xref rid="bb0140" ref-type="bibr">Kay and Thompson, 2001</xref>). It induces the expression of <italic>ecmA</italic> and <italic>ecmB</italic>, two genes that encode closely related extracellular matrix proteins. PstO cells and PstO-ALC utilize the cap-site distal region of the <italic>ecmA</italic> promoter and their differentiation is induced by DIF-1 (<xref rid="bb0050 bb0215" ref-type="bibr">Early et al., 1993; Thompson and Kay, 2000</xref>). PstB cells express <italic>ecmB</italic> at a higher level than <italic>ecmA</italic> and their differentiation is also induced by DIF-1 (<xref rid="bb0125 bb0145 bb0260" ref-type="bibr">Jermyn and Williams, 1991; Keller and Thompson, 2008; Saito et al., 2008</xref>). By analyzing the development and DIF-1 induction of the lrrB- strain we derive evidence for a selective involvement of LrrB in ecmB expression.</p>

Following the removal of adaptor sequences all the reads were 18 bp in length but the TopHat short read mapper requires reads of at least 20 bp (<xref rid="bb0225" ref-type="bibr">Trapnell et al., 2009</xref>). Addition of the CATG NlaIII restriction site motif to the 5′ end of all reads gave 22 bp reads allowing TopHat mapping (v1.0.13 allowing for two splice mismatches).

Quantifying expression values with Cufflinks v0.8.2 (<xref rid="bb0230" ref-type="bibr">Trapnell et al., 2010</xref>) against the Ensembl transcriptome resulted in approximately 8500 transcripts with mapped reads for both samples, of which approximately 5200 transcripts had an FPKM value of &gt; 5.

        <title>Development of lrrB- cells occurs differently in darkness and in light</title>
        <p>When lrrB- cells are plated on agar plates under uniform overhead light development proceeds normally up to the tipped aggregate stage but the structures formed are relatively squat and the slug stage is markedly extended (<xref rid="f0005" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>A). Eventually, after 30 to 36 h, culminants are formed but these are aberrant, displaying multiple spore beadlets that are incompletely elevated up the stalk (<xref rid="f0005" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>B). When lrrB- cells are plated on agar in darkness development proceeds up to the tipped aggregate stage but the structures formed are squat and more apically rounded than the parental structures. They elongate, to form stumpy slug-like structures (arrowed in <xref rid="f0010" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>) but these rapidly transform into bullet-shaped upright mounds. These remain indefinitely arrested in their development, even when transferred into the light. We term this dark stalling, because the cells remain developmentally competent; if the arrested structures are mechanically disaggregated and transferred to the light small fruiting bodies are formed (data not shown).</p>

        <title>lrrB- slugs are defective in environmental responsiveness</title>
        <p>Wild type <italic>Dictyostelium</italic> slugs exhibit extremely sensitive and accurate oriented migration toward a dim lateral light source as well as highly sensitive orientation in shallow temperature gradients. These phototactic and thermotactic responses have been well studied and are known to be controlled by cells in the anterior of the slug (reviewed in <xref rid="bb0075" ref-type="bibr">Fisher, 2001</xref>), although the roles of the specific subpopulations of prestalk cells in that region are not defined. In view of the different developmental phenotypes of lrrB- cells in the light and the dark, it was of interest to determine if phototaxis and thermotaxis responses were defective. When lrrB- cells are plated on charcoal agar plates slugs are formed but they are profoundly defective in both phototaxis and thermotaxis (<xref rid="f0015" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>). It is well established that the signaling pathways for phototaxis and thermotaxis converge early so that most of the signaling molecules involved are required for both behaviors. The defects in phototaxis and thermotaxis by lrrB- slugs suggest either that LrrB is a direct participant in photosensory and thermosensory signaling or that it is required for the correct differentiation or localization in the anterior region of cells that control these responses.</p>

        <title>lrrB- slugs are defective in pstO differentiation</title>
        <p>To investigate the anatomy of lrrB- slugs, we used markers of prestalk and prespore differentiations. EcmAO:lacZ contains the entire promoter of the <italic>ecmA</italic> gene and is expressed in the pstA region, the pstO region and many of the ALC. EcmAO:lacZ expression appears normal in the mutant strain (<xref rid="f0020" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref>A). However markers derived from the component parts of the ecmAO promoter, ecmA:lacZ and ecmO:lacZ, give a different picture — pstA differentiation appears normal but, even after extended slug migration, there is little or no ecmO:lacZ staining in the pstO zone (<xref rid="f0020" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref>B). There is an accumulation of ecmO:lacZ stained cells at the rear of the slug, so it could, in principle, be that pstO cells are formed but fail to sort properly to the pstO region. However, we favor the alternative explanation; that there are cells at the position of the pstO band that can utilize the entire ecmAO promoter but that cannot utilize the ecmO promoter sub-region. This explanation is supported by analysis of the prespore marker pspA:lacZ, a marker of prespore differentiation (<xref rid="f0020" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref>B), and by neutral red staining, a generic marker for prestalk cells and ALC (<xref rid="f0020" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref>A). Both markers reveal a normal-sized prestalk zone in the lrrB- slugs.</p>
        <p>Several key functions of the slug, such as tip dominance and the control of entry into culmination, are mediated by the tip-organizer cells; a cone of cells located in the extreme slug anterior (<xref rid="bb0110 bb0185 bb0200" ref-type="bibr">Gaudet et al., 2008; Rubin and Robertson, 1975; Smith and Williams, 1980</xref>). CudA is a transcription factor with a bipartite promoter. Cap-site proximal elements direct specific gene expression in prespore cells, while distal elements direct expression in tip organizer cells (<xref rid="bb0100" ref-type="bibr">Fukuzawa et al., 1997</xref>). Parental and lrrB- cells were transformed with CudA-tip:GFP, which contains a GFP reporter driven by the tip-organizer specific elements of <italic>cudA</italic>. The parental and mutant slugs show similar GFP expression patterns, with a cluster of fluorescent cells in the tip (<xref rid="f0020" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref>C).</p>

        <title>In synergy experiment lrrB- cells are excluded from the prestalk zone</title>
        <p>Thus tip-organizer differentiation appears to be normal in the mutant when the mutant cells are developing alone. However, synergy experiments reveal a major defect in cell sorting behavior of the entire anterior prestalk population. Genetically marked versions of the mutant and parental strains were generated by transformation with A15:GFP, a semi-constitutively expressed GFP reporter. When an excess of unmarked lrrB- cells is co-developed to the slug stage with A15:GFP labeled parental cells, in a 9:1 mixture, the marked parental cells selectively accumulate in the front half of the prestalk zone: the pstA region (<xref rid="f0025" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref>A). Conversely, when an excess of unlabeled parental cells are co-developed with A15:GFP marked null cells, the labeled lrrB- cells are excluded from the anterior and instead lie scattered in the rear, prespore zone: mainly concentrated toward the middle of the zone. The lack of complete reciprocity between the two arms of the synergy experiment presumably reflects a sorting hierarchy that is more complex than simple prestalk vs prespore.</p>
        <p>A similar pattern is observed in synergy experiments using cells marked by their expression of ecmAO:lacZ as a generic marker of prestalk differentiation (<xref rid="f0025" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref>B). Thus, in the presence of an excess of parental cells, prestalk differentiation occurs in the lrrB- mutant but the cells are excluded from the prestalk zone and concentrate toward the middle of the prespore region. This implies a cell autonomous defect in cell sorting in the null mutant. The converse experiment supports this notion, because the parental prestalk cells become enriched in the anterior of the prestalk region (<xref rid="f0025" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref>B).</p>
        <p>The phototaxis defect of the lrrB- strain is also cell autonomous. In a synergy experiment, using an increasing proportion of parental cells, there is a progressive improvement in the accuracy of phototaxis that plateaus at 10–25% wild type cells (data not shown). This correlates well with the results of the above experiment using GFP marked cells (<xref rid="f0025" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref>A), which suggests that most of the prestalk cells in such a mixture are phototactically competent, parental cells.</p>

        <title>lrrB- slugs display aberrant gene expression patterns</title>
        <p>The patterns of gene expression in standing slugs of parental and lrrB- strains developing under overhead light were compared by expression profiling. Profiling was performed using a microarray bearing genomic DNA fragments that represent over 80% of the predicted genes (<xref rid="bb0015" ref-type="bibr">Bloomfield et al., 2008</xref>) and a similar analysis was performed using deep RNA sequencing. For those genes that change their expression by a factor of at least two-fold there was an approximate 20% overlap between the two methods: comprising 4 genes with increased expression and 28 with decreased expression (<xref rid="t0005" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). Strikingly, when the 28 genes with decreased expression are analyzed on dictyExpress (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.ailab.si/dictyexpress">http://www.ailab.si/dictyexpress</ext-link>) for the ratio of their expression in purified prestalk and prespore cells there is a greater than three-fold imbalance. Sixteen (57%, red in <xref rid="t0005" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>) are prestalk-enriched while only five (17%, blue in <xref rid="t0005" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>) are prespore-enriched. This seems likely to be significant because of the 231 randomly selected genes, analyzed applying the same discrimination criterion, 24% were prestalk-enriched and 25% prespore-enriched (data not shown).</p>
        <p>The results for three of the genes with increased expression and six of the genes with decreased expression (asterisked in <xref rid="t0005" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>) were confirmed by QPCR on the same RNAs used for deep RNA sequencing. Five of the genes, <italic>ampA</italic>, <italic>ecmB</italic>, <italic>aifD</italic>, <italic>csaA</italic> and <italic>mybZ</italic> were then re-analyzed over a mini-developmental time course encompassing the period when the lrrB- becomes visibly aberrant and these results further confirmed the differences (data not shown). Finally, full expression patterns were obtained for <italic>ampA</italic> and <italic>ecmB</italic>, by QPCR using a complete developmental time course. The <italic>ecmB</italic> gene is commonly used as a marker for culmination. It encodes an extracellular matrix protein that is very closely related to EcmA. AmpA is a disintegrin domain containing protein with an anti-adhesion function (<xref rid="bb0020" ref-type="bibr">Blumberg et al., 2002</xref>). For completeness, we included <italic>ecmA</italic> in this analysis even though its expression was not detected as being altered in the expression profiling.</p>
        <p>Starting at about 12 h of development the lrrB- strain shows an approximately two-fold reduction in <italic>ecmA</italic> expression relative to the control. EcmB expression is, as expected from the microarray, deep RNA sequencing and the mini-developmental time course, &gt; 5-fold lower than the control at later stages. AmpA is first expressed earlier in development than <italic>ecmA</italic> or <italic>ecmB</italic> and expression is initially similar in the parental and lrrB- strains. At times after 10 h of development there is a two to three fold higher level of <italic>ampA</italic> expression in the mutant strain. In both strains <italic>ampA</italic> expression decreases during culmination.</p>

        <title>lrrB- cells are defective in ancillary stalk cell differentiation</title>
        <p>In parental slugs ecmB:lacZ is most highly expressed in the pstAB cells: a cone of cells near the slug tip, partially over-lapping but distinct from the tip organizer cells. This is also true for the lrrB- strain but occasionally, and under conditions that we have been entirely unable to control, we also observe large circular clusters, “spots”, comprising ecmB:lacZ expressing cells, scattered throughout the prespore region (data not shown). In the lrrB- strain at culmination the stalk is much slower in its journey down through the prespore mass than that of the parental strain (<xref rid="f0035" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7</xref>). Sometimes there are multiple stalk fragments within one culminant (arrowed in <xref rid="f0035" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7</xref>A) and the stalk is generally misshapen, often forming a spiral (<xref rid="f0035" ref-type="fig">Figs. 7</xref>B, C and D).</p>
        <p>Normally, two <italic>ecmB</italic>-expressing stalk-ancillary populations, the upper and lower cup, cradle the nascent spore head. The stalk tube becomes embedded in a third group of <italic>ecmB</italic>-expressing stalk cells, the outer basal disc. In the lrrB- mutant ecmB:lacZ is sporadically and weakly expressed in cells located at the approximate position normally occupied by the upper cup. These cells often form a spot very similar to those sporadically observed in the slug (arrowed in <xref rid="f0035" ref-type="fig">Figs. 7</xref>B and E). In the lrrB- structures there is no <italic>ecmB</italic> expression in the lower cup, although there are amoeboid cells at the position normally occupied by the lower cup. The outer basal disc is physically absent (<xref rid="f0035" ref-type="fig">Figs. 7</xref>E, F and G). In sum the above observations are consistent with the QPCR analysis, showing that the endogenous <italic>ecmB</italic> gene is poorly expressed in the lrrB- strain.</p>
        <p>We next analyzed culmination using markers specific for the stalk-ancillary structures. <italic>AmpA</italic> is expressed in the upper cup, lower cup and outer basal disc; expression appears to be repressed in any cells that enter the stalk tube (<xref rid="bb0025" ref-type="bibr">Casademunt et al., 2002</xref>). In parental culminants an ampA:lacZ reporter shows the expected staining pattern (<xref rid="f0040" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8</xref>). In lrrB- culminants ampA:lacZ is, like <italic>ecmB</italic>, weakly expressed in the upper cup region and it is not expressed in the cells located at the position of the lower cup. Strikingly, ampA:lacZ is also expressed, ectopically, within the stalk in lrrb- culminants. We further confirmed these observations using a reporter for <italic>mrrA</italic> (<xref rid="bb0235" ref-type="bibr">Tsujioka et al., 2007</xref>), another gene that is expressed in the upper and lower cups and the basal disc and that is not expressed in the stalk (<xref rid="f0040" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8</xref>).</p>
        <p>The direct precursors of the lower cup and outer basal disc are the pstB cells, a loosely clustered group of cells that is apposed to the ventral surface of the slug. They stain strongly with neutral red and express <italic>ecmB</italic> at a high level relative to <italic>ecmA</italic> (<xref rid="bb0135" ref-type="bibr">Jermyn et al., 1996</xref>). They move continuously along the length of the slug and often accumulate near the prestalk–prespore boundary when the slug rears up (<xref rid="bb0045" ref-type="bibr">Dormann et al., 1996</xref> and <xref rid="f0045" ref-type="fig">Fig. 9</xref>, lower left image). lrrB- slugs display little or no neutral red staining on the ventral surface of the slug, although there are staining cells in the extreme tail of the slug: in the rearguard (<xref rid="f0045" ref-type="fig">Fig. 9</xref>).</p>

        <p>LrrB has effects on specific gene expression during early development and it seemed possible that these changes might exert a “knock-on” effect, indirectly causing the late developmental phenotypes. One way to investigate this possibility is to attempt to revert the late phenotypes of the lrrB- strain by expressing LrrB from a late promoter. If the effect of the mutation is indeed indirect this would allow the early defect to manifest itself late in development, i.e. late expression of LrrB should fail to rescue development of the lrrB- strain. Since it seems very likely that the overt LrrB functions in late development are exerted in prestalk cells, we used the ecmAO promoter for this purpose When stably transformed into cells the ecmAO:LrrB-CTAP construct reverts the late developmental aberrations and rescues phototaxis (<xref rid="f0055" ref-type="fig">Figs. 11</xref>B, C and D).</p>

        <p>The lrrB- mutant displays a condition-dependent aberration in slug formation that is, to our knowledge, hitherto undescribed. In darkness development arrests in a process we term dark stalling. The existence of dark stalling in the mutant suggests that parental cells receive some kind of positive stimulus from the light. Since the parental cells can culminate in the absence of light the stimulatory signal is presumably redundant with a parallel, light independent system. If the lrrB- strain were defective in this parallel system this would lead to dark stalling.

        <title>Defects in slug behavior</title>
        <p>The prestalk region of the slug controls various aspects of slug behavior, including phototaxis and thermotaxis (<xref rid="bb0075" ref-type="bibr">Fisher, 2001</xref>). Both these latter processes are highly defective in the lrrB- mutant. Although this could indicate a direct role for LrrB in photosensory and thermosensory signaling it is also possible that LrrB is required for the correct differentiation or localization of anterior cell subpopulations that are needed for phototaxis and thermotaxis. Our observation that PstO cells fail to differentiate properly in lrrB- slugs suggests that PstO cells play an essential role in slug photosensory and thermosensory responses. This is consistent with recent observations that phototaxis and thermotaxis are defective and PstO cells appear to mislocalize in a mutant lacking a novel HECT ubiquitin ligase (C.R.L. Thompson, pers. comm.). These two sets of results are the first to suggest an essential role in phototaxis and thermotaxis for a specific subpopulation of prestalk cells in the slug.</p>

        <title>Can defects in prestalk differentiation account for defective slug formation and behavior?</title>
        <p>The above observations indicate aberrations in the prestalk region of lrrB- slugs. Several of the biological functions of the prestalk zone, including cAMP production, have been attributed to the tip-organizer cells. However, a reporter construct reveals normal tip-organizer regions in mutant slugs. Also ecmAO:lacZ and ecmA:lacZ, markers of prestalk differentiation, identify discrete pstO and pstA regions. Significantly perhaps ecmO:lacZ is not expressed in the pstO region of the mutant. We take this to mean that the complete promoter of the <italic>ecmA</italic> gene, the ecmAO region, behaves as more than the sum of its component <italic>ecmA</italic> and <italic>ecmO</italic> parts. The fact that cells in the lrrB null “pstO” region differ from parental pstO cells in not being competent to express ecmO:lacZ implies that at least one signaling pathways to gene expression differs in the mutant.

        <p>In the lrrB- strain stalk formation is very slow and the stalk is often aberrant in shape.

Thus <italic>ampA</italic> and <italic>mrrA</italic>, two markers normally only expressed in stalk-ancillary structures, are ectopically expressed within the stalks of lrrB- culminants. This perhaps indicates that LrrB forms part of a repressive pathway that renders the two genes inactive in cells that enter the stalk tube. The fact that <italic>ampA</italic> is not normally expressed in cells that enter the stalk tube also presumably explains why <italic>ampA</italic> expression is higher in the lrrB- strain.</p>

        <p>Mutants in DIF-1 biosynthesis and DIF-1 signaling differentiate to form culminants that lack an outer basal disc and this is also true for the lrrB- strains. The DIF-1 signaling pathway that directs pstO-specific gene expression is partly understood. DimA and DimB, two b-ZIP transcription factors, and MybE are involved (<xref rid="bb0105 bb0120 bb0220 bb0255" ref-type="bibr">Fukuzawa et al., 2006; Huang et al., 2006; Thompson et al., 2004; Zhukovskaya et al., 2006</xref>). Although there is an apparent defect in pstO differentiation in the lrrB- strain, the DIF-1 induced <italic>ecmA</italic> gene is only two fold less well induced than in control cells. However, there is an almost complete ablation of DIF-1-induced <italic>ecmB</italic> gene expression in the mutant. Thus <italic>ecmA</italic> and <italic>ecmB</italic> can be at least partially uncoupled in their induction by DIF-1 in monolayer cells.</p>
        <p>There is other, prior evidence for a divergence of these two signaling pathways. Under the induction conditions used in their original identification <italic>ecmA</italic> responded by an increase in the rate of its mRNA accumulation just 15 min after DIF-1 addition while <italic>ecmB</italic> responded only after several hours (<xref rid="bb0130" ref-type="bibr">Jermyn et al., 1987</xref>).

        <title>Functional analyses of LrrB and its interaction partner</title>
        <p>The lrrB- strain displays multiple defects in multicellular development and slug behavior but these could, in principle, all be the consequence of an earlier dysfunction. This possibility is rendered less likely by our demonstration that the late phenotypes of the lrrB- strain can be reverted by expressing LrrB under the control of a prestalk-specific promoter. The fact that a prestalk promoter can act in this way also supports the notion that the primary lesion(s) are indeed in prestalk cell function.</p>
        <p>LrrB contains, in addition to its SH2 domain, two protein–protein interaction modules: leucine-rich repeats and 14-3-3 binding sites. It is therefore relevant that we could also show, by a mutant rescue experiment using a semi-constitutive promoter, that the SH2 domain continues to be essential at late stages. Interaction of LrrB with CldA in early development depends upon an intact LrrB SH2 domain and elevated tyrosine phosphorylation levels, generated by the addition of pervanadate to the cells (<xref rid="bb0210" ref-type="bibr">Sugden et al., 2010</xref>). One potential, but by no means exclusive, explanation of these results is that the LrrB SH2 domain binds a regulatable phosphotyrosine residue on CldA. It would seem probable, from analysis of the development and phototaxis of a cldA- strain, that LrrB utilizes a different interaction partner during the later stages of development. The fact that LrrB has such diverse roles in late development makes it probable that, as with metazoan SH2 adaptor proteins such as GRB2 (<xref rid="bb0030 bb0060 bb0115 bb0165 bb0175 bb0190 bb0195 bb0240 bb0245" ref-type="bibr">Cheng et al., 1998; Felsch et al., 1998; Hardy et al., 2007; Mainiero et al., 1995; Nizzari et al., 2007; Scaplehorn et al., 2002; Skolnik et al., 1993; Wang et al., 1995; Zhang et al., 2003</xref>), LrrB interacts with more than one effector protein to participate in multiple signaling pathways.</p>

        <p>Analysis of phototaxis and thermotaxis in the lrrB- strain. (A) Qualitative slug phototaxis (method B). Digitized slug trails of wild type Ax2, and two lrrB- clones, cl8 and cl13. Slug trails were plotted from a common origin so that the source of light is to the right of the figures. Wild type slugs migrate directly toward the light source whereas lrrB- slugs show disoriented, bimodal phototaxis. (B) Quantitative phototaxis (method B) at defined cell densities was performed on wild type Ax2, and two lrrB- transformants. The trails were digitized and analyzed using directional statistics to determine their accuracies of phototaxis (κ) at the defined cell densities. In comparison to the wild type Ax2 strain the two lrrB- clones show very low accuracies of phototaxis. (C) Qualitative slug thermotaxis (method B). Scanned image of stained trails from slugs during thermotaxis in a stable, linear temperature gradient of 0.2 °C/cm. The direction toward the warmth is to the right of the figure and the temperature at the inoculation site was 20 °C (<xref rid="bb0080" ref-type="bibr">Fisher and Williams, 1982</xref>). Thermotactic orientation by the lrrb null mutants, cl8 and cl13, is strongly impaired. (D) Quantitative thermotaxis of lrrB- clones. Temperatures designated 1 through 8 correspond to temperatures from 14 °C in 2 °C steps to 28 °C, with a temperature gradient at the agar surface of 0.2 °C/cm. The slug trails were digitized and analyzed using directional statistics (<xref rid="bb0085" ref-type="bibr">Fisher et al., 1981</xref>). Positive values indicate the accuracy of positive thermotaxis (κ) toward the warmth, negative values indicate the accuracy of negative thermotaxis (κ) toward the cold and a value of zero indicates there was no preferred direction. Ax2 displayed high accuracies of positive thermotaxis at T4–T7 and low positive accuracies of thermotaxis at the cooler temperatures with Ax2 displaying negative accuracies of thermotaxis at T8. The two lrrB- clones, cl8 and cl13 displayed low accuracies of thermotaxis at all temperature points. It is normal for the accuracy of thermotaxis by wild type Ax2 slugs to decline above and below the growth temperature and either approaches zero or even switches to negative thermotaxis at T1 (<xref rid="bb0090 bb0035" ref-type="bibr">Fisher et al., 1997; Darcy et al., 1994</xref>). At some of the higher temperatures slugs of the lrrB- clones did not migrate so thermotaxis could not be measured.</p>

(A) Ax2 and lrrB- cells were stained with neutral red, a vital dye which specifically stains prestalk cells, then developed under unidirectional light for 17 h (left panels). Ax2 and lrrB- cells, expressing the prestalk marker ecmAO:lacZ, were developed under unidirectional light, fixed and stained for <italic>ß</italic>-galactosidase (right panels). (B) Ax2 and 2 lrrB- clones (cl8 and cl13) expressing pstA specific, pstO specific and prespore specific markers, developed under unidirectional light, fixed and stained for <italic>ß</italic>-galactosidase. (C) Ax2 and lrrB- cells expressing the GFP reporter; CudA-tip:GFP, were developed under unidirectional light and GFP was visualized in the tips of the slugs.

        <p>Analysis of the developmental distribution of lrrB- cells in synergy with Ax2. (A) Ax2 or lrrB- cells carrying a GFP marker under the semi-constitutive actin15 promoter (A15:GFP), were mixed in a 1:9 ratio with unlabeled cells and developed under unidirectional light for 17 h. The localization of the GFP marked cells was visualized in slugs. Z-stacks from confocal slices are presented with the outline of the whole slug. Control slugs from a synergy between cells carrying a GFP marker and the parent cells (both Ax2, and lrrB-), showed uniform prestalk/prespore distribution. (B) Ax2 or lrrB- cells expressing the prestalk marker ecmAO:lacZ, were mixed in a 1:9 ratio with the parent cells and developed under unidirectional light for 17 h. Upper panels show slugs from 100% Ax2 and lrrB- expressing ecmAO:lacZ and the lower panels the slugs from synergy experiments. Slugs are outlined where necessary.</p>

        <p>Neutral red stained cells in Ax2 and lrrB- slugs migrating on agar. The living slugs were photographed from the side. Arrows indicate the positions of pstB cells in the control Ax2 images. These position(s) are highly variable along the AP axis (<xref rid="bb0045" ref-type="bibr">Dormann et al., 1996</xref>). Note that there are also some red staining cells in the rearguard regions of all the slugs pictured. In this particular experiment the anterior prestalk regions were poorly stained (cf with <xref rid="f0020" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref>A). Anterior staining with neutral red is intrinsically variable from experiment to experiment. However, the basal staining of pstB cells is highly reproducible and easy to visualize when slugs are viewed from the side; because they are concentrated in a very tight layer on the ventral surface.</p>

(A) lrrB- cells expressing control CTAP, LrrB-CTAP or SH2 domain point-mutated LrrB; LrrB-CTAPmutR were developed on water agar for 24 h under overhead light. The aberrant development of the lrrB- was rescued by expression of the LrrB but not by the control or SH2 domain mutated LrrB. (B) Ax2 and lrrB- cells expressing ecmAO:LrrB-CTAP were developed on water agar for 22 h under overhead light. Aberrant lrrB- culmination was rescued by expression of LrrB under the control of the prestalk specific promoter.
