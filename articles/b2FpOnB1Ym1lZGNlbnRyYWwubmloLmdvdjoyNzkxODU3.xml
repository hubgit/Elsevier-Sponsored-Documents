        <title>Abstract</title>
        <p>Influenza viruses induce a host shut off mechanism leading to the general inhibition of host gene expression in infected cells. Here, we report that the large subunit of host RNA polymerase II (Pol II) is degraded in infected cells and propose that this degradation is mediated by the viral RNA polymerase that associates with Pol II. We detect increased ubiquitylation of Pol II in infected cells and upon the expression of the viral RNA polymerase suggesting that the proteasome pathway plays a role in Pol II degradation. Furthermore, we find that expression of the viral RNA polymerase results in the inhibition of Pol II transcription. We propose that Pol II inhibition and degradation in influenza virus infected cells could represent a viral strategy to evade host antiviral defense mechanisms. Our results also suggest a mechanism for the temporal regulation of viral mRNA synthesis.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>Viruses have developed a wide range of mechanisms to inhibit the expression of host genes during the process of virus replication (<xref rid="bib27" ref-type="bibr">Lyles, 2000</xref>). Although this might provide the virus with higher levels of cellular resources such as nucleoside triphosphates to be used for the biosynthesis of viral gene products, it is now believed that the major role of virus-induced inhibition of host gene expression is to inhibit antiviral host response. Viruses can interfere with various steps in host gene expression—transcription, RNA processing and transport, and translation. For many RNA viruses, the host transcriptional apparatus represents a logical target for inhibition of host gene expression as they replicate in the cytoplasm of the host cell without any obvious requirement for host transcriptional activity. Influenza viruses are an exception, since they replicate in the nucleus of the host cell and require an active host RNA polymerase II (Pol II) (<xref rid="bib1 bib9" ref-type="bibr">Amorim and Digard, 2006; Engelhardt and Fodor, 2006</xref>). In particular, influenza virus cannibalizes host Pol II transcripts to produce RNA fragments that are needed to initiate viral mRNA synthesis (<xref rid="bib3 bib22" ref-type="bibr">Bouloy et al., 1978; Krug et al., 1979</xref>). Moreover, ongoing Pol II transcription is required for the nuclear export of viral mRNAs (<xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr">Amorim et al., 2007</xref>). Therefore influenza viruses are absolutely dependent on active transcription by host Pol II for their replication and indeed, inhibitors of Pol II, i.e. α-amanitin or actinomycin D, block influenza virus replication (<xref rid="bib24 bib28" ref-type="bibr">Lamb and Choppin, 1977; Mark et al., 1979</xref>).</p>
      <p>However, recently our group showed that the influenza virus RNA polymerase complex, a heterotrimer of three subunits, polymerase basic protein 1 (PB1), polymerase basic protein 2 (PB2), and polymerase acidic protein (PA), binds to the C-terminal domain (CTD) of the large subunit of initiating Pol II and proposed that this interaction leads to the inhibition of Pol II activity in influenza virus infected cells (<xref rid="bib5 bib10" ref-type="bibr">Chan et al., 2006; Engelhardt et al., 2005</xref>). We hypothesized that on one hand, hijacking the host transcriptional machinery might allow the virus to gain access to factors, e.g. capped RNA fragments, splicing factors, and factors for the assembly of viral mRNPs, on the other, it could contribute to the inhibition of host gene expression which inevitably would affect genes involved in antiviral host responses. Therefore, the ability of the viral RNA polymerase to inhibit Pol II might be a significant factor in viral pathogenesis.</p>
      <p>Indeed, the RNA polymerase has been shown to be an important determinant of influenza virus pathogenicity (<xref rid="bib30" ref-type="bibr">Naffakh et al., 2008</xref>). Several mutations in the RNA polymerase genes have been described that contribute to the increased pathogenicity of influenza viruses in various in vivo model systems; for example, it is now believed that the trimeric RNA polymerase complex of the 1918 pandemic strain was a significant contributor to the unusually high pathogenicity associated with this viral strain (<xref rid="bib44 bib47" ref-type="bibr">Tumpey et al., 2005; Watanabe et al., 2009</xref>). The RNA polymerase genes were also found to contribute to the high virulence of the human H5N1 influenza virus isolates (<xref rid="bib41" ref-type="bibr">Salomon et al., 2006</xref>). A more efficient RNA polymerase could lead to viruses with increased replication potential which could efficiently outcompete and escape the host innate immune responses (<xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr">Grimm et al., 2007</xref>). However, a more direct role of the viral RNA polymerase in determining pathogenicity has not been excluded. For example, the RNA polymerase might be involved in virus–host interactions directly leading to the inhibition of the expression of antiviral host genes or in a general inhibition of host gene expression.</p>
      <p>The association of the viral RNA polymerase with the host Pol II transcriptional machine is well documented (<xref rid="bib10 bib29 bib36" ref-type="bibr">Engelhardt et al., 2005; Mayer et al., 2007; Rameix-Welti et al., 2009</xref>), but the implications of this interaction for the functionality of Pol II remain to be understood. Recently, Rodriguez and colleagues reported that influenza virus infection causes a specific degradation of the large subunit of Pol II and suggested that the proteolytic activity of the PA subunit of the viral RNA polymerase was involved (<xref rid="bib38" ref-type="bibr">Rodriguez et al., 2007</xref>). Here we investigated the effects of the association between the influenza virus RNA polymerase and Pol II on host transcription further. We found that the binding of the viral RNA polymerase to the initiating form of Pol II induces its inhibition possibly via triggering ubiquitylation and proteasome-mediated degradation. We propose that the viral RNA polymerase-mediated inhibition of Pol II plays an important role in inhibiting host gene expression and consequently, in inhibiting antiviral host response. This might have important implications for viral pathogenesis.</p>

        <title>Influenza virus infection induces degradation of Pol II</title>
        <p>Our group reported previously that the influenza virus RNA polymerase complex binds to the CTD of the serine-5 phosphorylated form of Pol II at 3 h post infection (<xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">Engelhardt et al., 2005</xref>). The CTD of Pol II represents a landing pad for numerous host factors involved in host mRNA processing (<xref rid="bib19 bib20 bib35" ref-type="bibr">Hirose and Manley, 2000; Howe, 2002; Proudfoot et al., 2002</xref>) and we hypothesized that its association with the viral RNA polymerase could affect Pol II function. To address this, we infected human 293T cells with influenza A/WSN/33 virus, harvested cells at 3, 6, 9, and 12 h post infection, and analyzed Pol II by Western blot using an antibody recognizing both the non-phosphorylated transcriptionally unengaged (Pol IIa) and the phosphorylated transcriptionally engaged (Pol IIo) forms of Pol II (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>). We found a significant reduction in both forms of Pol II at late points post infection. In particular, we observed a reduction in the Pol IIo form from 6 h post infection. In comparison, there was a slight delay in the reduction of the Pol IIa form with a clear reduction from 9 h post infection.</p>
        <p>Next we analyzed the same cell lysates with antibodies that specifically recognize the serine-2 and serine-5 phosphorylated forms of Pol II. Serine-5 phosphorylation of the CTD is characteristic of the initiating form of Pol II, engaged in capping, while serine-2 phosphorylation is prevalent in the CTD of the elongating form of Pol II (<xref rid="bib32" ref-type="bibr">Palancade and Bensaude, 2003</xref>). We found a clear reduction in both the initiating and elongating forms from 6 h post infection with a more pronounced effect on the elongating form (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>). We have also analyzed β-actin and two different subunits of host RNA polymerase III, RPC32 and RPC39, none of which showed any detectable reduction (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>), suggesting that the effect on Pol II was not due to a general proteolytic degradation of host proteins in influenza virus infected cells. A Western blot analysis of the PA subunit of the influenza virus RNA polymerase complex confirmed that the cells were infected (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>). Taking into account that the half-life of the large subunit of Pol II is about 12–16 h (<xref rid="bib14 bib38" ref-type="bibr">Goldberg and St John, 1976; Rodriguez et al., 2007</xref>) (Chan and Fodor, unpublished), these results show that there is a specific degradation of the large subunit of Pol II at late points post infection in cells infected with influenza virus.</p>

        <title>Viral infection results in the reduction of Pol II engaged at the promoter region of Pol II genes</title>
        <p>Previously, our group reported that influenza virus infection inhibits Pol II elongation (<xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">Chan et al., 2006</xref>). In particular, it was found that there was a significant reduction in Pol II densities in the coding, but not the promoter region, of the DHFR and β-actin genes in influenza virus infected cells compared to mock-infected cells at 3 h post infection. Having observed that the large subunit of Pol II is degraded in infected cells, we performed a chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assay to examine the densities of Pol II at the promoter region of the DHFR and β-actin genes during the viral life cycle (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>). We found no change in Pol II associated with the β-actin promoter at 3 h post infection. In contrast, at 6, 9, and 12 h post infection, there was a reduction. Interestingly, for the DHFR promoter we observed a transient increase in Pol II at 3 h post infection, followed by its gradual reduction at later time points. These results are consistent with the observations above that Pol II is degraded in influenza virus infected cells at late points post infection. As a control, we have also analyzed the association of Pol III with the 7SK RNA promoter (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>). We found no effect at 3 h post infection although at the 6 h time point there was an apparent reduction. However, in contrast to Pol II, no further reduction was observed at 9 and 12 h suggesting that influenza virus might affect Pol II and Pol III function differentially.</p>

        <title>Mechanism of Pol II degradation in influenza virus infected cells</title>
        <p>Having determined that the large subunit of Pol II is specifically degraded in influenza virus infected cells, resulting in the decrease of transcriptionally engaged initiating Pol II at the promoter region of Pol II genes, we were interested in establishing the molecular mechanisms of Pol II degradation. Interestingly, overexposure of Western blot analyses of the initiating form of Pol II from influenza virus infected cells revealed high molecular weight Pol II-specific signals at late points post infection (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>A). These results suggested that Pol II could be a substrate for secondary modifications, i.e. ubiquitylation, leading to an increase in its molecular weight. To test this hypothesis, we performed immunoprecipitation of influenza virus infected cell lysates with a ubiquitin-specific antibody (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>B). Western blot analysis of the immunoprecipitates with a Pol II-specific antibody showed that increasing amounts of the ubiquitylated initiating form of the large subunit of Pol II were present late in infection. Taken together, these results suggest that influenza virus infection results in an increase in the ubiquitylation of Pol II or, alternatively, Pol II is present in complexes containing ubiquitylated proteins. However, the observed increase in the mobility of the large subunit of Pol II (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>A) suggests that the large subunit itself is a substrate for ubiquitylation. Thus, influenza virus infection results in Pol II ubiquitylation possibly leading to its degradation by the proteasome pathway.</p>
      </sec>
      <sec>
        <title>The role of the viral RNA polymerase in the degradation of Pol II</title>
        <p>Next we asked the question whether the binding of the trimeric influenza virus RNA polymerase complex to the CTD of the large subunit of Pol II plays a role in triggering Pol II degradation in virus infected cells. We hypothesized that binding of the viral RNA polymerase complex to the CTD of the initiating form of Pol II could lead to Pol II pausing or arrest. This would trigger mechanisms analogous to those observed during DNA damage or in cells treated with α-amanitin when Pol II arrest is followed by the recruitment of the proteasome to Pol II leading to its ubiquitylation and degradation (<xref rid="bib37 bib43 bib50" ref-type="bibr">Ratner et al., 1998; Somesh et al., 2005; Yang et al., 2003</xref>). We transfected 293T cells with plasmids expressing the PB1, PB2, and PA subunits of the viral RNA polymerase complex or performed transfections with a control plasmid (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref>). When all three subunits were co-expressed, we observed a decrease in the non-phosphorylated unengaged (Pol IIa) and an increase in the phosphorylated transcriptionally engaged (Pol IIo) forms of Pol II. Western blot analysis of the serine-5 phosphorylated form of Pol II confirmed that at least some of the increased Pol IIo signal was due to the accumulation of the initiating form (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref>). Interestingly, we also observed a decrease in the non-phosphorylated form in cells expressing the PA subunit alone, suggesting that the overexpression of PA is sufficient to induce the degradation of the non-phosphorylated form of Pol II. However, PA failed to induce an accumulation of the phosphorylated form, including the serine-5 phosphorylated form. Neither the expression of PB1 alone nor PB2 alone had a detectable effect on any of the Pol II forms (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref>). Taken together, these results support the hypothesis that binding of the trimeric viral RNA polymerase to the CTD of Pol II induces Pol II arrest and its transient accumulation in a transcriptionally engaged form. This could result in the depletion of the transcriptionally unengaged form of Pol II as observed in cells expressing all three RNA polymerase subunits. However, the observation that the expression of the PA subunit alone can result in the decrease of the non-phosphorylated form of Pol II suggests that free PA, not associated with PB1 and PB2, could contribute to the depletion of the transcriptionally unengaged form of Pol II.</p>
        <p>In order to investigate whether the binding of the trimeric viral RNA polymerase to Pol II is a prerequisite for the accumulation of the transcriptionally engaged from, we took advantage of a PB2 mutant with reduced Pol II binding activity in the context of the trimeric viral RNA polymerase complex. This mutant, F363A, originally identified as a mutant deficient in cap-binding (<xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr">Fechter et al., 2003</xref>) and subsequently found to have reduced Pol II-binding activity (<xref rid="bib26" ref-type="bibr">Loucaides et al., 2009</xref>), showed a reduced induction of the accumulation of the transcriptionally engaged Pol IIo form (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figs. 5</xref>A and B). The serine-5 phosphorylated form of Pol II was not affected by the expression of this mutant RNA polymerase trimer either. In contrast, another PB2 mutant, F404A (<xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr">Fechter et al., 2003</xref>), that retains wild-type levels of Pol II binding (<xref rid="bib26" ref-type="bibr">Loucaides et al., 2009</xref>), induced a similar increase in Pol IIo, including the serine-5 phosphorylated form, as the wild-type trimeric RNA polymerase. Co-expression of PB1 and PA in the absence of PB2 (2P) resulted in no detectable effect on the Pol IIo and serine-5 phosphorylated forms of Pol II. In all cases when viral RNA polymerase subunits were expressed, a reduction in the Pol IIa form was observed, presumably due to the expression of the PA subunit. The Pol II-binding properties of the PB2 mutant polymerase complexes were confirmed by immunoprecipitation with a PA-specific antibody (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref>C). Further immunoprecipitation experiments with an antibody specific for ubiquitin followed by Western blot analysis of the immunoprecipitates for Pol II showed that the accumulated serine-5 phosphorylated form of Pol II is ubiquitylated (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref>C). Taken together, these results show that the accumulation of the ubiquitylated serine-5 phosphorylated form of Pol II is dependent on the binding of the viral RNA polymerase.</p>

      <sec>
        <title>Expression of the viral RNA polymerase results in the inhibition of Pol II transcription</title>
        <p>Our group previously demonstrated that Pol II elongation is inhibited in cells infected with influenza virus (<xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">Chan et al., 2006</xref>). The results described above suggest that this could be due to Pol II arrest induced by the viral trimeric RNA polymerase binding to the initiating Pol II and/or to PA targeting the non-engaged form of Pol II for degradation. To address whether the expression of the viral RNA polymerase complex inhibits Pol II transcription, we used an IFN-inducible luciferase reporter gene system (<xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">Didcock et al., 1999</xref>). We transfected 293T cells with a combination of plasmids to express the viral RNA polymerase subunits and a luciferase reporter and treated the cells with interferon. Cell lysates were analyzed for luciferase activity (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6</xref>A). IFN treatment resulted in a strong induction of luciferase activity [compare Control (+) to Control (−)]. The expression of individual PA or the trimeric polymerase complex resulted in a statistically significant (as assessed by a Student's <italic>t</italic> test) reduction in reporter gene activity, while the expression of individual PB1 or PB2 had no effect (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6</xref>A, left panel). In order to determine whether the binding of the trimeric RNA polymerase complex to the serine-5 phosphorylated form of Pol II contributes to the reduction, we used the PB2 F363A and F404A mutants described above (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6</xref>A, right panel). We observed a statistically significant reduction in reporter levels for both mutants although the reduction was less pronounced in the case of the F363A mutant suggesting that binding to Pol II might play a role. Neither of the individual PB2 mutants had a detectable effect on reporter levels.</p>
        <p>We also analyzed the effect of the expression of the influenza virus RNA polymerase on an endogenous gene by taking advantage of the interferon-inducible ISG15 gene (<xref rid="bib40" ref-type="bibr">Sadler and Williams, 2008</xref>). We transfected 293T cells with a combination of plasmids to express the viral RNA polymerase subunits as above and treated the cells with interferon to induce the ISG15 gene. We isolated total RNA and analyzed the levels of ISG15 mRNA by using quantitative RT-PCR (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6</xref>B). IFN treatment resulted in a relatively modest increase in the ISG15 mRNA. Neither the expression of PB1 alone nor PB2 alone affected the expression of the ISG15 mRNA. However, we found a statistically significant reduction in ISG15 mRNA expression when individual PA or all three RNA polymerase subunits (3P WT) were expressed. In contrast, we observed no statistically significant reduction in ISG15 mRNA levels when the wild-type PB2 was replaced with the F363A mutant that reduces the binding of the trimeric RNA polymerase to Pol II. The PB2 mutant with the F404A mutation that binds Pol II similar to the wild-type, inhibited ISG15 mRNA expression to the same level as the wild-type polymerase complex. The presence of PB2 was important for the inhibition of ISG15 mRNA expression as the PB1-PA dimer had no significant effect.</p>
        <p>Taking the results from the two assays together, we conclude that the expression of individual PA or the trimeric viral RNA polymerase complex results in the inhibition of Pol II activity. The ability of the trimeric complex to inhibit Pol II appears to be affected by its Pol II-binding activity suggesting that the association between the viral and host transcriptional machineries is an important factor in the observed Pol II inhibition.</p>

        <title>Effect of Pol II inhibition and degradation on the regulation of viral RNA transcription and replication</title>
        <p>Our results show that Pol II is inhibited and degraded in cells infected with influenza virus. However, influenza virus mRNA synthesis is absolutely dependent on Pol II activity as viral mRNAs are primed by capped RNA fragments derived from host mRNAs (<xref rid="bib3 bib22" ref-type="bibr">Bouloy et al., 1978; Krug et al., 1979</xref>). The splicing of viral mRNAs and their nuclear export might also be dependent on active Pol II (<xref rid="bib1 bib2 bib3 bib9 bib22" ref-type="bibr">Amorim and Digard, 2006; Amorim et al., 2007; Bouloy et al., 1978; Engelhardt and Fodor, 2006; Krug et al., 1979</xref>). How can one reconcile these apparently contradictory processes? How does the inhibition/degradation of Pol II affect the regulation of viral transcription and replication?</p>
        <p>In order to address these questions, we investigated the accumulation of viral RNAs in infected cells at various times post infection. We infected 293T cells with influenza A/WSN/33 virus, isolated total RNA from infected cells at 3, 4.5, 6, and 9 h post infection, and analyzed viral RNA levels by a primer extension assay (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7</xref>A). Our results show that while maximal mRNA accumulation occurs relatively early during the replication cycle (between 3 and 4.5 h), vRNA synthesis continues late in infection (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7</xref>B). These results are in agreement with numerous previous studies reporting an early peak in mRNA synthesis, followed by exclusive vRNA synthesis late in infection (<xref rid="bib18 bib25 bib42" ref-type="bibr">Hatada et al., 1989; Lee and Seong, 1998; Shapiro et al., 1987</xref>). Although several hypotheses have been put forward to explain this phenomenon (<xref rid="bib33 bib46 bib51 bib52" ref-type="bibr">Perez and Donis, 1998; Watanabe et al., 1996; Ye et al., 1989; Zvonarjev and Ghendon, 1980</xref>), often referred to as a “switch” from transcription to replication, the precise molecular mechanisms involved remain unknown.</p>
        <p>Our group proposed that viral mRNA synthesis requires the association observed between the viral RNA polymerase and Pol II as it might allow the viral transcriptional machinery to access the cap structure of nascent RNAs as well as RNA processing factors (<xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">Engelhardt et al., 2005</xref>). In order to investigate this association during the viral life cycle, we performed immunoprecipitations of the viral RNA polymerase using a PA-specific antibody and analyzed the immunoprecipitates for the presence of the initiating form of Pol II by using Western blotting (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7</xref>C). We observed that a maximal association between the viral RNA polymerase and Pol II occurs at 3 h post infection. At later time points, a much reduced association was observed. We also performed a ChIP assay of the association of the viral RNA polymerase with Pol II promoter DNA (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7</xref>D). We found maximal association with the β-actin promoter at 3 h post infection with dramatically reduced values at the later time points. Similar results were observed using the DHFR gene. The observation that the maximal association between the viral RNA polymerase and Pol II approximately coincides with the maximal viral mRNA accumulation suggests that the two processes might be linked providing support for the hypothesis that an association between the viral RNA polymerase and Pol II is required for viral transcription. These results also suggest that the dramatic downturn in mRNA synthesis that occurs at approximately 4.5 h post infection could be the result of the inhibition/degradation of Pol II induced by the accumulating levels of the viral RNA polymerase in infected cells.</p>

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>In this paper, we show that the large subunit of Pol II is degraded in 293T cells infected with influenza A/WSN/33 virus. Degradation of Pol II was also observed in HeLa cells infected with A/WSN/33 (H1N1) (Chan and Fodor, unpublished), MDCK cells infected with SC35 or SC35M viruses (H7N7) (Gabriel and Fodor, unpublished), and 293T, COS-1, HeLa, and NLB2 cells infected with A/WSN/33 (H1N1) or A/Victoria/3/75 (H3N2) (<xref rid="bib38" ref-type="bibr">Rodriguez et al., 2007</xref>), suggesting that Pol II degradation is a general phenomenon that can be induced by various subtypes of influenza virus. There is an increasing body of evidence that viruses have developed a multitude of strategies to inhibit host gene expression (<xref rid="bib27" ref-type="bibr">Lyles, 2000</xref>). A general inhibition of host gene expression is likely to represent an efficient mechanism to suppress the activation of innate immune responses that are inevitably activated upon viral infection as a consequence of the expression of a variety of viral factors (e.g. 5′pppRNA, dsRNA) that are recognized by the host cell as foreign (<xref rid="bib13 bib34" ref-type="bibr">Garcia-Sastre and Biron, 2006; Pichlmair and Reis e Sousa, 2007</xref>). Thus, influenza virus-induced Pol II degradation could represent a novel mechanism of inhibiting antiviral host responses.</p>
      <p>How could influenza virus infection lead to the degradation of the large subunit of Pol II? We observed degradation of both the non-phosphorylated and phosphorylated forms of the large subunit of Pol II and there was a particularly severe decrease in the elongating (serine-2 phosphorylated) form from 6 h post infection. During viral infection, we detected the accumulation of Pol II forms recognized by an antibody specific for the serine-5 phosphorylated form that migrated at a higher than expected molecular weight. These results suggested that Pol II might be ubiquitylated and indeed, an immunoprecipitation using a ubiquitin-specific antibody, resulted in the detection of increased levels of ubiquitylated Pol II in infected cells. Ubiquitylation often targets proteins for degradation via the proteasome pathway (<xref rid="bib48" ref-type="bibr">Weissman, 2001</xref>) suggesting that the proteasome might be involved in the degradation of Pol II. We attempted to use proteasome inhibitors (e.g. MG132, lactacystin) to investigate whether Pol II degradation could be prevented in influenza virus infected cells. Although we observed a delay in the degradation of Pol II, these results were inconclusive as the proteasome inhibitors also resulted in a delay in viral infection (Chan and Fodor, unpublished).</p>
      <p>How is ubiquitylation of Pol II triggered in influenza virus infected cells? We speculate that binding of the viral RNA polymerase to the CTD of the initiating form of Pol II could trigger mechanisms that are known to be activated during DNA damage. DNA damage results in the arrest of Pol II at the DNA lesion often leading to the clearance of arrested Pol II by its degradation via ubiquitylation (<xref rid="bib37 bib43 bib50" ref-type="bibr">Ratner et al., 1998; Somesh et al., 2005; Yang et al., 2003</xref>). Indeed, ChIP data show an increased association of Pol II with the DHFR promoter which is consistent with the idea of Pol II arrest. Upon the co-expression of the three subunits of the viral RNA polymerase complex, an accumulation of the serine-5 phosphorylated form of Pol II was also observed in the absence of viral infection. These results lend support to the hypothesis that transcriptional arrest triggered by the binding of the viral RNA polymerase to the initiating form of Pol II might be responsible for Pol II ubiquitylation.</p>
      <p>Recently, <xref rid="bib38" ref-type="bibr">Rodriguez et al. (2007</xref>) proposed that the proteolytic activity of the PA subunit of the viral RNA polymerase could be responsible for the degradation of Pol II in influenza virus infected cells. In particular, they showed that infection with a recombinant virus encoding a PA point mutant with reduced proteolytic activity resulted in a transient delay in the degradation of the hypophosphorylated from of Pol II. They also showed that the levels of hypophosphorylated Pol II were decreased in cells expressing the three subunits of the viral RNA polymerase, while expression of PA alone had no effect on Pol II levels. We confirmed that the levels of the non-phosphorylated form of Pol II were reduced upon the co-expression of the three viral RNA polymerase subunits, but surprisingly, overexpression of the single subunit PA resulted in a similar reduction of the non-phosphorylated form of Pol II. Thus, two mechanisms might operate during viral infection that could result in Pol II degradation: on one hand, individual PA, not complexed with PB1 and PB2, could induce the degradation of free unengaged form of Pol II; on the other hand, the trimeric polymerase complex by binding to the initiating form of Pol II induces its arrest and ubiquitylation that eventually lead to proteasome-mediated degradation. However, in virus infected cells, as opposed to transfected cells expressing PA alone, most of PA is likely to be present in complex with PB1 and PB2. Therefore, during viral infection, Pol II degradation induced by PA might not play a significant role and most Pol II degradation could be the consequence of Pol II inhibition induced by the binding of the trimeric viral RNA polymerase complex to the initiating form of Pol II.</p>
      <p>We cannot, however, exclude the possibility that the proteolytic activity of PA also plays a role in inducing Pol II degradation in the context of the RNA polymerase trimer. It is possible that the association of PA with PB1 in the absence of wild-type PB2 (2P) or presence of a mutant PB2 (PB2 F363A) leads to a conformational change in PA that results in the inhibition of its proteolytic activity. Moreover, it should be noted that, in contrast to viral infections, no decrease in the transcriptionally engaged form of Pol II was detected in cells expressing the viral RNA polymerase subunits during the course of the experiment (up to 24 h post transfection) although the non-phosphorylated unengaged form was reduced. This suggests that for triggering degradation of the transcriptionally engaged form of Pol II, a viral factor not present in the transfected cells is required. We can only speculate that cleavage of the nascent host transcript by the viral RNA polymerase that is dependent on the presence of vRNA (<xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr">Hagen et al., 1994</xref>) might be needed for the triggering of Pol II degradation. Removal of the 5′ cap structure of the nascent host transcript by the endonucleolytic activity of the viral RNA polymerase would lead to the exposure of the 5′ end of the transcript. Such transcript could be attacked by host nucleases, i.e. Xrn2, that play a role in the termination of Pol II after cleavage of the nascent transcript downstream of the poly(A) signal (<xref rid="bib49" ref-type="bibr">West et al., 2004</xref>). We have attempted to address this question by reconstituting recombinant RNPs in 293T cells by transfecting plasmids to express the viral RNA polymerase subunits, NP, and a vRNA. However, we observed no reduction in the engaged form of Pol II possibly due to the low percentage of cells expressing functional RNPs (results not shown). Clearly, further studies are required to fully understand the molecular mechanisms of Pol II degradation in influenza virus infected cells.</p>
      <p>Irrespective of the exact molecular mechanism, influenza virus-induced Pol II degradation inevitably affects the regulation of viral RNA synthesis. Previous studies suggested that influenza virus has developed a mechanism to regulate the synthesis of its own RNAs such that during the early stages viral mRNA is synthesized to allow viral protein production, while late in infection vRNA synthesis dominates to ensure sufficient levels of vRNA for the assembly of progeny virions (<xref rid="bib42" ref-type="bibr">Shapiro et al., 1987</xref>). We confirmed previous results that viral mRNA synthesis peaks early during viral infection, while vRNA synthesis continues late in infection. However, our results suggest that the dramatic shut-off of viral mRNA synthesis late in infection might be the result of reduced interaction between the viral and host transcriptional machineries due to Pol II degradation. We found that maximal association between the viral RNA polymerase and Pol II occurred at about 3 h post infection, close to the time of maximal viral mRNA production. As infection proceeds, Pol II is degraded which results in the reduction of the association of the viral RNA polymerase with the Pol II transcriptional machinery as shown by co-immunoprecipitations and ChIP assay (see <xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7</xref>). In conclusion, we propose that the degradation of the large subunit of Pol II could be the cause for the reduction in viral mRNA synthesis late in infection. This contrasts the model by <xref rid="bib38" ref-type="bibr">Rodriguez et al. (2007</xref>) who proposed that the degradation of the hypophosphorylated form of Pol II correlates with the onset of viral transcription.</p>
      <p>We showed in this study that, in the presence of the PA subunit and the trimeric RNA polymerase complex that binds to Pol II, the expression of IFN-stimulated Pol II genes is inhibited, suggesting that Pol II inhibition induced by the viral RNA polymerase could play a role in the suppression of antiviral host responses. Another mechanism, proposed for inhibiting host gene expression and antiviral host responses involves the viral non-structural protein 1 (NS1) (<xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr">Hale et al., 2008</xref>). NS1 was shown to interfere with host gene expression by inhibiting host mRNA polyadenylation via interactions with the 30-kDa subunit of the host cleavage and polyadenylation factor (CPSF30) and nuclear poly(A)-binding protein (PABII) (<xref rid="bib6 bib31" ref-type="bibr">Chen et al., 1999; Nemeroff et al., 1998</xref>). More recently, the viral RNA polymerase has been proposed to form an integral component of the CPSF30-NS1 protein complex (<xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr">Kuo and Krug, 2009</xref>). Thus, influenza virus might have developed a complex mechanism leading to host shut-off involving multiple viral components.</p>
      <p>In summary, our findings suggest a novel mechanism for the inhibition of host gene expression in influenza virus infected cells. The viral RNA polymerase might play a crucial role in this mechanism by hijacking the host Pol II transcriptional machinery, eventually leading to the degradation of the large subunit of Pol II. Inhibition and degradation of Pol II will inevitably affect the expression of genes involved in antiviral host responses and therefore the pathogenicity of influenza viruses. While this study was under review, <xref rid="bib39" ref-type="bibr">Rodriguez et al. (2009</xref>) provided experimental evidence that attenuated strains of influenza A viruses do not induce degradation of Pol II and proposed that the ability of influenza viruses to inhibit and degrade Pol II might contribute to their virulence. It remains to be determined to what extent RNA polymerases from various influenza virus strains, including highly pathogenic H5N1 viruses, differ in their ability to trigger Pol II inhibition and degradation.</p>

Luciferase expression was induced by IFN treatment and expression levels were determined by a luciferase assay. Luciferase levels in induced cells [Cntrl (+)] were set to 1. Cntrl (−), uninduced cells. Data presented are an average from 4 independent transfections, with standard deviations shown. (B) Effect of viral RNA polymerase on the IFN-inducible endogenous ISG15 gene. Transcription of the ISG15 gene was induced by IFN treatment and ISG15 mRNA levels quantitated by RT-PCR. mRNA levels in induced cells not expressing RNA polymerase subunits [Cntrl (+)] were set to 1. Cntrl (−), uninduced cells. Data presented are an average from 6 independent transfections with standard deviations shown. Two-tailed unpaired Student's <italic>t</italic> tests were performed to assess whether the values in the presence of RNA polymerase were significantly different from the values in their absence.
