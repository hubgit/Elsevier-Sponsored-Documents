        <title>Summary</title>
        <p>Centrosome separation, critical for bipolar spindle formation and subsequent chromosome segregation during mitosis, occurs via distinct prophase and prometaphase pathways <xref rid="bib1 bib2 bib3" ref-type="bibr">[1–3]</xref>. Kinesin-5 (Eg5), a microtubule (MT) motor, pushes centrosomes apart during bipolar spindle assembly <xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>; its suppression results in monopolar spindles and mitotic arrest <xref rid="bib5 bib6" ref-type="bibr">[5, 6]</xref>. Forces that antagonize Eg5 in prophase are unknown. Here we identify a new force generating mechanism mediated by the guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) Tiam1, dependent on its ability to activate the GTPase Rac. We reveal that Tiam1 and Rac localize to centrosomes during prophase and prometaphase, and Tiam1, acting through Rac, ordinarily retards centrosome separation. Importantly, both Tiam1-depleted cells in culture and Rac1-deficient epithelial cells in vivo escape the mitotic arrest induced by Eg5 suppression. Moreover, Tiam1-depleted cells transit more slowly through prometaphase and display increased chromosome congression errors. Significantly, Eg5 suppression in Tiam1-depleted cells rectifies not only their increased centrosome separation but also their chromosome congression errors and mitotic delay. These findings identify Tiam1-Rac signaling as the first antagonist of centrosome separation during prophase, demonstrate its requirement in balancing Eg5-induced forces during bipolar spindle assembly in vitro and in vivo, and show that proper centrosome separation in prophase facilitates subsequent chromosome congression.</p>

      <title>Results and Discussion</title>
      <p>Tiam1 is involved in a number of cellular processes including migration and the regulation of cell-cell adhesions and survival <xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>. AlthoughTiam1 has been implicated in cellular proliferation <xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>, its role during the cell cycle is unknown. In MDCK II cells expressing either GFP-tagged Tiam1 or HA-tagged Tiam1, we were intrigued to observe a signal not only at cell-cell adhesions (as previously described <xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>) but also at the two microtubule (MT) asters surrounding the centrosomes. This localization was apparent both before nuclear envelope breakdown (NEBD) in prophase cells (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>A and <xref rid="app2" ref-type="sec">Figure S1</xref>A, available online) and after NEBD in prometaphase cells (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>B and <xref rid="app2" ref-type="sec">Figure S1</xref>B) and was dependent on MTs because it was lost after nocodazole treatment (data not shown). However, in metaphase cells, Tiam1 localization to centrosomal regions was no longer detected (right-hand cell, <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>B).</p>
      <p>To investigate the potential function of Tiam1 at centrosomes, we generated MDCK II cells expressing doxycycline-inducible short hairpin interfering RNAs (shRNAs) to Tiam1 (two independent targets: RNAi #1 and RNAi #2) or control scrambled shRNA (Scr). Upon doxycycline addition, endogenous Tiam1 protein was depleted from cells containing either Tiam1 shRNA target (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>C). In subcellular fractions enriched for centrosomes, endogenous Tiam1 cosedimented with the centrosomal marker γ-tubulin and was depleted from these fractions after Tiam1 shRNA expression (<xref rid="app2" ref-type="sec">Figures S1</xref>C and S1D). Moreover, immunofluorescence analysis confirmed that endogenous Tiam1 localized to centrosomal regions in early mitosis (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figures 1</xref>D and S1E); this signal was depleted after Tiam1 shRNA expression (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>D).</p>
      <p>Because Tiam1 is a Rac-specific activator, we determined where Rac localizes in early mitosis. GFP-tagged Rac was detected at cell-cell adhesions as shown previously <xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>; however, it also colocalized with the two MT asters in prophase (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>E) and prometaphase cells (<xref rid="app2" ref-type="sec">Figure S1</xref>F). Endogenous Rac showed a similar localization (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>F and <xref rid="app2" ref-type="sec">Figure S1</xref>G). Hence, Tiam1 and Rac localize to centrosomal regions in early mitosis.</p>
      <p>During prophase, duplicated centrosomes begin to separate around the nuclear envelope before NEBD (prophase pathway), in preparation to form a bipolar spindle in prometaphase <xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>. We hypothesized that Tiam1 signaling might function to regulate centrosome movement during prophase. Hence, we measured centrosome separation in control and Tiam1-depleted prophase cells. Strikingly, the intercentrosomal distance increased by over 40% in Tiam1-depleted cells (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>A). This defect was efficiently rescued by expressing RNAi-resistant wild-type Tiam1 (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>A) but not the GEF mutant Tiam1 (Q1191A, K1195A <xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>), which is unable to activate Rac (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>A). Treatment with a specific Rac inhibitor (NSC-23766 <xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>) also increased centrosome separation in prophase cells (<xref rid="app2" ref-type="sec">Figure S2</xref>A). After Tiam1 depletion, a similar increase in centrosome separation was seen in mouse P1 cells (<xref rid="app2" ref-type="sec">Figures S2</xref>B and S2C). Thus, Tiam1 functions via Rac to oppose centrosome separation in prophase.</p>
      <p>Relatively little is known about centrosome separation during prophase, with conflicting evidence for the involvement of Eg5 <xref rid="bib13 bib14" ref-type="bibr">[13, 14]</xref>. Treatment with the Eg5-specific inhibitor Monastrol <xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref> led to a significant decrease in the intercentrosomal distance of prophase MDCK II cells (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>B); similar results were obtained with a second Eg5-specific inhibitor S-trityl-L-cysteine <xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref> (STLC, data not shown). Tiam1 also localizes to the cortex in prophase cells (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>A and <xref rid="app2" ref-type="sec">Figure S1</xref>A), and cortical movements driven by Myosin-II activity (regulated by Rho kinase [ROCK]) are required after NEBD for centrosome separation via astral MT connections <xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>. To gain mechanistic insight into the regulation of centrosome separation in prophase, we treated cells with inhibitory concentrations of blebbistatin (Myosin-II inhibitor) or Y-27632 (ROCK inhibitor) (<xref rid="app2" ref-type="sec">Figures S2</xref>D and S2E). However, neither treatment affected centrosome separation in control prophase cells (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>B) or the increased intercentrosomal distance in Tiam1-depleted prophase cells (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>C). In contrast, low concentrations of Taxol, a MT-stabilizing agent, although not effecting centrosome separation in control cells, prevented the increased centrosomal separation of Tiam1-depleted prophase cells (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>C). These data suggest that in prophase, centrosome separation is driven by Eg5 but is unlikely to involve cortical movements. Further, the effects of Tiam1 depletion on centrosome separation, although probably independent of the cortex, may be mediated through microtubule stabilization, although how is currently unclear. A role for Tiam1 in stabilizing MTs during front-rear polarization in cell migration has previously been reported <xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>. We detected no change in the localization of Eg5 in Tiam1-depleted cells (data not shown), suggesting that this is independent of Tiam1.</p>
      <p>Using time-lapse fluorescence microscopy of cells expressing β-Tubulin-GFP, we followed centrosome movement in individual cells through prophase. After Tiam1 depletion, there was no significant difference in the period between the onset of centrosome separation and NEBD compared with controls (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>D). However, the centrosome separation rate in prophase was significantly increased in Tiam1-depleted cells compared to controls (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figures 2</xref>D and 2E). Further, Tiam1-depleted cells maintained their increased centrosome separation after NEBD (<xref rid="app2" ref-type="sec">Figure S2</xref>F). Consistent with this, the intercentrosomal distance in prometaphase from fixed samples was also significantly increased after Tiam1 depletion (<xref rid="app2" ref-type="sec">Figure S2</xref>G) or Rac inhibition (<xref rid="app2" ref-type="sec">Figure S2</xref>H). However, the rate of centrosome separation during prometaphase was markedly reduced compared to prophase and was unaffected by Tiam1 depletion (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>E). To investigate further the role of Tiam1 in centrosome separation in prometaphase, we arrested cells in a monopolar prometaphase state with Monastrol, then released them to allow mitosis to proceed. We found that centrosomes in Tiam1-depleted cells separate significantly further 10 min after washout compared to controls; however, at 20 min the increase was not significant (<xref rid="app2" ref-type="sec">Figure S2</xref>I). Thus, Tiam1-Rac affects centrosome separation apparently independently of the nuclear envelope and seemingly more potently when centrosomes are in close proximity. This property may account for the greater influence that inhibition of this pathway exerts during prophase compared to prometaphase.</p>
      <p>To examine whether Tiam1 antagonizes Eg5 during bipolar spindle formation, we treated control and Tiam1-depleted cells for 18 hr with STLC or Monastrol at concentrations that reduce but do not abolish Eg5 activity <xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>. In controls, Eg5 suppression resulted in mainly monopolar mitotic spindles (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>A): ∼60% in STLC-treated cells (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>B) and ∼70% in Monastrol-treated cells (<xref rid="app2" ref-type="sec">Figure S3</xref>A). However, after Tiam1 depletion, mitotic spindles were mainly bipolar (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>A), with significantly fewer monopolar spindles: ∼15% in STLC-treated (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>B) and ∼30% in Monastrol-treated cells (<xref rid="app2" ref-type="sec">Figure S3</xref>A).</p>
      <p>We next confirmed that the bipolar spindles formed in Tiam1-depleted cells, under conditions of Eg5 suppression, were functional and able to segregate chromosomes later in mitosis. In control cells, the proportion of mitotic cells in anaphase or telophase significantly reduced from over 32% to ∼20% after STLC (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>C) and ∼12% after Monastrol treatment (<xref rid="app2" ref-type="sec">Figure S3</xref>B). Conversely, in Tiam1-depleted cells, Eg5 suppression had little effect on the proportion of mitotic cells in anaphase or telophase: ∼32% after STLC (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>C) and over 25% after Monastrol treatment (<xref rid="app2" ref-type="sec">Figure S3</xref>B). Consistent with this, in controls the mitotic index increased by over 4.5-fold after Eg5 suppression (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>D and <xref rid="app2" ref-type="sec">Figure S3</xref>C) as a result of the monopolar spindles activating the spindle assembly checkpoint (SAC), thereby delaying mitosis. However, Tiam1 depletion prevented the accumulation of mitotic cells after Eg5 suppression (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>D and <xref rid="app2" ref-type="sec">Figure S3</xref>C).</p>
      <p>To determine whether Eg5 function is antagonized by Rac signaling in vivo, we utilized conditional <italic>Rac1</italic> knockout mice <xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>, focusing on the intestinal epithelium. Epithelial cells within intestinal crypts are highly proliferative and arrest rapidly after administration of various drugs <xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>; this arrest is visualized via an accumulation of mitotic figures within the intestinal crypt. We first conditionally deleted Rac1 within the intestinal epithelium (as described in the <xref rid="app2" ref-type="sec">Supplemental Experimental Procedures</xref>). Three days after Cre induction <xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>, the intestinal epithelium from <italic>AhCre Rac1<sup>fl/fl</sup></italic> mice showed loss of Rac1 (<xref rid="app2" ref-type="sec">Figures S3</xref>D and S3E). Deletion of Rac1 at this stage did not affect proliferation (data not shown) or cellularity (<xref rid="app2" ref-type="sec">Figure S3</xref>F). We next treated mice with 25 mg/kg STLC and investigated mitotic arrest after 3 hr. In wild-type mice, STLC treatment induced a significant mitotic arrest (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figures 3</xref>E and 3F; <italic>Rac1<sup>+/+</sup></italic> control versus <italic>Rac1<sup>+/+</sup></italic> STLC-treated). Remarkably, Rac1 deletion completely rescued the induction of mitotic arrest (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figures 3</xref>E and 3F; <italic>Rac1<sup>+/+</sup></italic> STLC-treated versus <italic>Rac1<sup>fl/fl</sup></italic> STLC-treated). Moreover, in wild-type mice the proportion of mitotic cells in anaphase was significantly reduced after STLC treatment, indicating an arrest prior to this stage (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>G). This reduction was significantly prevented after Rac1 deletion (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>G). Taken together, these data indicate that Tiam1-Rac signaling antagonizes Eg5 function, both in vitro and in vivo; in their absence mitotic cells can assemble bipolar spindles and complete mitosis under conditions of reduced Eg5 activity.</p>
      <p>We tested whether Tiam1 depletion induced further mitotic defects by using time-lapse fluorescence microscopy of cells expressing Histone-2B-GFP. In controls, chromosomes efficiently congressed to the metaphase plate after NEBD and rapidly entered anaphase (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>A). In over 60% of Tiam1-depleted cells, however, chromosomes spent over 15 min aligning on the metaphase plate (compared to less than 5% of controls), before eventually aligning and entering anaphase (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>A). The duration of early mitotic stages, calculated from numerous movies, indicated that Tiam1 depletion specifically increased prometaphase duration (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>B).</p>
      <p>Analysis of fixed mitotic cells revealed that after Tiam1 depletion, congression errors were over 2.5-fold higher than controls (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>C; see <xref rid="app2" ref-type="sec">Figure S4</xref>A for example images). Similar results were obtained after Tiam1 depletion in P1 cells (data not shown). Importantly, this chromosome congression defect was efficiently rescued by expressing RNAi-resistant wild-type Tiam1, but not GEF mutant Tiam1 (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>C). Moreover, cells treated with Rac inhibitor also displayed significantly increased congression errors compared to controls (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>D; see <xref rid="app2" ref-type="sec">Figure S4</xref>B for example images), consistent with a role for Rac downstream of Tiam1. We confirmed that these congression errors observed in Tiam1-depleted cells were due to an increased prometaphase duration (<xref rid="app2" ref-type="sec">Figure S4</xref>C). Hence, cells with compromised Tiam1-Rac signaling fail to efficiently align chromosomes to the metaphase plate, resulting in a prolonged prometaphase. This is probably due to maintained activation of the SAC, which delays mitosis until all chromosome kinetochores are captured <xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>.</p>
      <p>Subsequently, we determined whether the increased centrosome separation of Tiam1-depleted cells leads to the congression errors. Using time-lapse fluorescence microscopy of individual mitotic cells expressing β-Tubulin-GFP, we confirmed that in the presence of STLC, the majority of Tiam1-depleted mitotic cells formed bipolar spindles (<xref rid="app2" ref-type="sec">Figure S4</xref>D); furthermore, the intercentrosomal distance in prometaphase was now similar to that found in untreated controls (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>E). Significantly, correcting the balance of forces during bipolar spindle formation completely rescued the chromosome congression errors resulting from Tiam1 depletion (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figures 4</xref>F and 4G) and restored normal mitotic progression (<xref rid="app2" ref-type="sec">Figures S4</xref>E and S4F). Together, these data indicate that the defects in chromosome congression induced by Tiam1 depletion are due to the increased centrosome separation.</p>
      <p>In conclusion, we have shown that Tiam1, acting through Rac, is a critical mediator of forces during bipolar spindle assembly. Tiam1-Rac signaling counteracts Eg5 during bipolar spindle formation in vitro and in vivo. To our knowledge, this is the first signaling module that retards centrosome separation during prophase in mammalian cells and the first demonstration of an increased rate of centrosome separation in prophase leading to chromosome congression defects. Importantly, we show that correcting the balance of forces, by attenuating Eg5 activity in Tiam1-depleted cells, completely rescues the defects in chromosome congression, allowing cells to satisfy the SAC and progress through mitosis normally (for a model see <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>H). There are numerous other pathways that promote <xref rid="bib1 bib3 bib20" ref-type="bibr">[1, 3, 20]</xref> and oppose <xref rid="bib13 bib21" ref-type="bibr">[13, 21]</xref> centrosome separation during bipolar spindle formation. This considerable overlap is not surprising given the importance of the bipolar mitotic spindle to the survival of eukaryotic cells, providing a number of fail-safes that decrease the risk of chromosome segregation errors during cell division.</p>

        <p>Tiam1-Rac Signaling Regulates Centrosome Separation during Early Stages of Mitosis</p>
        <p>(A) Control MDCK II cells, those depleted of Tiam1 (RNAi#1 and #2; plus dox), or those re-expressing RNAi#1-resistant Tiam1 (either WT or with a deactivating mutation in the GEF domain [GEF<sup>∗</sup>]) were fixed and costained with anti-α-tubulin, anti-γ-tubulin (or anti-pericentrin), and DAPI. The distance between centrosomes was measured in 3D for the indicated number of prophase cells.</p>
        <p>(B) Control MDCK II cells treated with vehicle (DMSO), Monastrol (200 μM for 4 hr), Y27632 (20 μM for 25 mins), or blebbistatin (50 μM for 25 min) were fixed and stained as in panel (A). The distance between centrosomes in prophase cells was measured in 3D.</p>
        <p>(C) Control MDCK II cells or those depleted of Tiam1 (RNAi#2; plus dox) were treated with Y27632 or blebbistatin (as described in B) or taxol (120 nM for 6 hr), fixed and stained as in (A). The distance between centrosomes in prophase cells was measured in 3D.</p>
        <p>(D and E) Control and Tiam1-depleted (RNAi #1; plus dox) cells expressing GFP-tagged β-tubulin were analyzed by fluorescence time-lapse microscopy. (D) Representative still images (Maximal-intensity projections) show control and Tiam1-depleted (RNAi#1; plus dox) cells initiating centrosome separation during prophase, where time 0:00 = NEBD. Scale bars represent 10 μm. (E) The distance between centrosomes at each time-point was measured in 3D throughout prophase and prometaphase for at least 22 control and Tiam1-depleted (RNAi#1; plus dox) cells; the centrosome separation rate was calculated as described in <xref rid="app2" ref-type="sec">Supplemental Experimental Procedures</xref>.</p>

        <p>Regulation of Centrosome Separation by Tiam1-Rac Signaling Is Required for Proper Chromosome Congression</p>
        <p>(A and B) Control and Tiam1-depleted (RNAi #1; plus dox) cells expressing GFP-tagged Histone-2B (H2B-GFP) were analyzed with fluorescence time-lapse microscopy as described in the <xref rid="app2" ref-type="sec">Supplemental Experimental Procedures</xref>. (A) Maximal-intensity projections of example still images from control and two Tiam1-depleted cells displaying intermediate (middle panel) or severe (lower panel) chromosome congression defects, where time 0:00 = first frame after NEBD. Arrowheads in the middle panel indicate a single unaligned chromosome. Scale bars represent 10 μm. (B) The durations of prophase, prometaphase, and metaphase were determined from time-lapse movies.</p>
        <p>(C) Control MDCK II cells, those depleted of Tiam1 (RNAi#1 and #2; plus dox), or those re-expressing RNAi#1-resistant Tiam1 (either WT or GEF mutant [GEF<sup>∗</sup>]) were fixed and stained with anti-α-tubulin and DAPI. Cells with chromosomes clearly aligned at the metaphase plate were scored for congression errors as described in the <xref rid="app2" ref-type="sec">Supplemental Experimental Procedures</xref> (45–300 cells/rep, n ≥ 3).</p>
        <p>(D) Parental MDCK II cells synchronized by double thymidine block (as described in the <xref rid="app2" ref-type="sec">Supplemental Experimental Procedures</xref>) and released for 6–8 hr into Rac inhibitor (NSC-23776) or mock treatment were fixed, stained, and analyzed as in (C) (45–300 cells/rep, n ≥ 3).</p>
        <p>(E) Tiam1-depleted (RNAi#1 and #2; plus dox) cells were left untreated or were treated with STLC (1 μM for 18 hr), fixed, and costained with anti-α-tubulin, anti-γ-tubulin (or anti-pericentrin), and DAPI. The distance between centrosomes was measured in 3D from prometaphase cells. The dotted line represents the normal intercentrosomal distance observed in untreated control cells.</p>
        <p>(F and G) Control or Tiam1-depleted cells were treated with STLC (1 μM for 18 hr) or left untreated. Samples were fixed and stained with anti-α-tubulin and DAPI. (F) Example single-plane images are shown, as well as (G) chromosome congression defects assessed as in (C), from control or Tiam1-depleted (RNAi#1 and #2; plus dox) cells treated with STLC or left untreated (45–300 cells/rep, n ≥ 3). In all cases data are presented as mean + SEM, <sup>∗</sup>p &lt; 0.05, <sup>∗∗</sup>p &lt; 0.001.</p>
        <p>(H) Model: Eg5 suppression in control cells leads to monopolar spindles and SAC activation. Conversely, Tiam1 depletion increases centrosome separation in early mitosis, leading to chromosome congression errors and SAC activation. However, Eg5 suppression within Tiam1-depleted cells restores centrosome separation to that of control Eg5 inhibitor-untreated mitotic cells, allowing efficient chromosome congression and progression through mitosis.</p>
