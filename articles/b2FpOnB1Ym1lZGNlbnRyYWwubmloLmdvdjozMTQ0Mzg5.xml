        <p>Adenosine triphosphate and its degradation product adenosine diphosphate excite sensory neurons via 2 different G protein-coupled receptors, P2Y<sub>1</sub> and P2Y<sub>2</sub>, which mediate inhibition K<sub>V</sub>7 and sensitization of TRPV<sub>1</sub> channels.</p>

      <abstract>
        <p>Nucleotides contribute to the sensation of acute and chronic pain, but it remained enigmatic which G protein-coupled nucleotide (P2Y) receptors and associated signaling cascades are involved. To resolve this issue, nucleotides were applied to dorsal root ganglion neurons under current- and voltage-clamp. Adenosine triphosphate (ATP), adenosine diphosphate (ADP), and uridine triphosphate (UTP), but not uridine diphosphate (UDP), depolarized the neurons and enhanced action potential firing in response to current injections. The P2Y<sub>2</sub> receptor preferring agonist 2-thio-UTP was equipotent to UTP in eliciting these effects. The selective P2Y<sub>1</sub> receptor antagonist MRS2179 largely attenuated the excitatory effects of ADP, but left those of 2-thio-UTP unaltered. Thus, the excitatory effects of the nucleotides were mediated by 2 different P2Y receptors, P2Y<sub>1</sub> and P2Y<sub>2</sub>. Activation of each of these 2 receptors by either ADP or 2-thio-UTP inhibited currents through K<sub>V</sub>7 channels, on one hand, and facilitated currents through TRPV<sub>1</sub> channels, on the other hand. Both effects were abolished by inhibitors of phospholipase C or Ca<sup>2+</sup>-ATPase and by chelation of intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup>. The facilitation of TRPV<sub>1</sub>, but not the inhibition K<sub>V</sub>7 channels, was prevented by a protein kinase C inhibitor. Simultaneous blockage of K<sub>V</sub>7 channels and of TRPV<sub>1</sub> channels prevented nucleotide-induced membrane depolarization and action potential firing. Thus, P2Y<sub>1</sub> and P2Y<sub>2</sub> receptors mediate an excitation of dorsal root ganglion neurons by nucleotides through the inhibition of K<sub>V</sub>7 channels and the facilitation of TRPV<sub>1</sub> channels via a common bifurcated signaling pathway relying on an increase in intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> and an activation of protein kinase C, respectively.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>Sensory dorsal root ganglion (DRG) neurons mediate the sensation of acute and chronic pain. Acute pain is elicited by thermal, mechanical, or chemical stimuli, whereas chronic pain results from the sensitization of sensory neurons most commonly due to inflammatory reactions. The sensitization is mediated by an “inflammatory soup” containing a plethora of signaling molecules, such as cytokines, neurotrophins, bradykinin, prostaglandins, and nucleotides. Interestingly, most analgesics target the synthesis, the release, or the receptors of these inflammatory mediators, as exemplified by inhibitors of cyclooxygenases, such as acetylsalicylic acid <xref rid="b0020" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>.</p>
      <p>Adenosine triphosphate (ATP) and other nucleotides are released from all cells in response to a variety of stimuli and mediate their effects via a class of receptors termed P2 <xref rid="b0125" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>: P2X receptors are ATP-gated cation channels composed of 3 of a repertoire of at least 7 different subunits (P2X<sub>1</sub> to P2X<sub>7</sub>) that assemble in homomers or heteromers. P2Y receptors are G protein-coupled receptors, and 8 different subtypes have been identified (P2Y<sub>1,2,4,6,11,12,13,14</sub>) <xref rid="b0005 b0065" ref-type="bibr">[1,13]</xref>. Sensory neurons express both P2X and P2Y receptors; in DRG neurons, the presence of all known P2X subunits but P2X<sub>7</sub> has been reported, and the predominating receptors are P2X<sub>3</sub> homomers and P2X<sub>2/3</sub> heteromers <xref rid="b0065 b0235" ref-type="bibr">[13,47]</xref>. Furthermore, the expression of P2X<sub>3</sub> is altered under conditions of chronic pain <xref rid="b0205 b0240" ref-type="bibr">[41,48]</xref>. Therefore, P2X<sub>3</sub> receptors are considered promising targets for novel analgesics <xref rid="b0060 b0220" ref-type="bibr">[12,44]</xref>.</p>
      <p>For P2Y receptors, expression of P2Y<sub>1</sub>,<sub>2</sub>,<sub>4</sub>,<sub>6</sub>,<sub>12</sub>,<sub>13</sub>,<sub>14</sub> has been reported in DRG neurons <xref rid="b0120 b0140 b0175" ref-type="bibr">[24,28,35]</xref>. Activation of P2Y<sub>2</sub> receptors excites DRG neurons, but the underlying mechanisms remained obscure <xref rid="b0150" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref>. The respective agonists, ATP and uridine triphosphate [UTP], trigger increases in intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> and the release of calcitonin gene-related peptide <xref rid="b0180" ref-type="bibr">[36]</xref>. UTP has also been reported to activate cutaneous C-fibers <xref rid="b0190" ref-type="bibr">[38]</xref>. Activation of P2Y<sub>1</sub> receptors, in contrast, was suggested to mediate analgesic effects through an inhibition of voltage-activated Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels (VACCs), which results in a reduction of transmitter release onto dorsal horn neurons <xref rid="b0100" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>. However, more recent data suggest that inhibition of VACCs is rather mediated by P2Y<sub>12</sub> instead of P2Y<sub>1</sub> receptors <xref rid="b0140" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref>. Moreover, P2Y<sub>1</sub> receptors were reported to mediate hyperalgesia <xref rid="b0140" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref>, and this effect was proposed to be mediated by a sensitization of TRPV<sub>1</sub> channels <xref rid="b0200" ref-type="bibr">[40]</xref>. Later on, however, the P2Y receptor involved in the sensitization of TRPV<sub>1</sub> channels by nucleotides was reported to be P2Y<sub>2</sub> <xref rid="b0135 b0155" ref-type="bibr">[27,31]</xref>. In addition, nucleotides were suggested to enhance nociception by modulating voltage-activated Na<sup>+</sup> channels in DRG neurons <xref rid="b0165" ref-type="bibr">[33]</xref>. Thus, it remained quite controversial which P2Y receptor subtypes control the functions of DRG neurons and whether the outcome is an increase or a decrease in nociception.</p>
      <p>In addition to the modulation of voltage-activated Na<sup>+</sup> and Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels, P2Y receptors mediate the modulation of various neuronal K<sup>+</sup> channels, including K<sub>V</sub>7 <xref rid="b0245" ref-type="bibr">[49]</xref>, Kir3.1/3.2 channels <xref rid="b0095" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>, and K<sub>Ca</sub>2 channels <xref rid="b0185" ref-type="bibr">[37]</xref>. Therefore, this study investigated which P2Y receptors control the excitability of DRG neurons, whether the modulation of K<sup>+</sup> channels might contribute to this effect, and what the underlying signaling mechanisms might be.</p>

        <title>Primary cultures of DRG neurons</title>
        <p>Primary cultures of dissociated DRG neurons from young rats were prepared as described previously <xref rid="b0160" ref-type="bibr">[32]</xref> with minor modifications. Briefly, ganglia were dissected from 10- to 12-day-old Sprague–Dawley rats that had been killed by decapitation in full accordance with all rules of the Austrian animal protection law (see <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.ris.bka.gv.at/GeltendeFassung.wxe?Abfrage=Bundesnormen&amp;Gesetzesnummer=20003541">http://www.ris.bka.gv.at/GeltendeFassung.wxe?Abfrage=Bundesnormen&amp;Gesetzesnummer=20003541</ext-link>) and the Austrian animal experiment by-laws (see <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.ris2.bka.gv.at/Dokumente/BgblPdf/2000_198_2/2000_198_2.pdf">http://www.ris2.bka.gv.at/Dokumente/BgblPdf/2000_198_2/2000_198_2.pdf</ext-link>). Dissected ganglia were incubated in collagenase (1.5 mg/mL; Sigma) and dispase (3.0 mg/mL; Boehringer Mannheim, Vienna, Austria) for 30 minutes at 37°C. Then, they were incubated in trypsin (0.25% trypsin; Worthington, Lakewood, NJ) for 15 minutes at 37°C, dissociated by trituration, and resuspended in Dulbecco modified Eagle medium (InVitrogen, Lofer, Austria) containing 4.5 g/L glucose, 10 mg/L insulin, 25 000 IU/L penicillin, and 25 mg/L streptomycin (InVitrogen), 50 μg/L nerve growth factor (R&amp;D Systems Inc., Minneapolis, MN), and 5% fetal calf serum (InVitrogen). Finally, dissociated cells were seeded onto 35-mm culture dishes coated with poly <sc>d</sc>-lysine (Sigma). The cultures were kept in a humidified 5% CO<sub>2</sub> atmosphere at 37°C. The medium was exchanged at least once per week.</p>

        <title>Electrophysiology</title>
        <p>All currents or potentials were recorded at room temperature (20°C to 24°C) from small-diameter DRG neurons after 1 to 2 days in culture using an Axopatch 200B amplifier and the pCLAMP 8.1 hard- and software (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA). All of the neurons investigated displayed capsaicin-induced currents (<italic>I</italic><sub>caps</sub>) and were thus assumed to provide nociceptive functions. In a few experiments, capsaicin-insensitive neurons were used for comparison. Membrane excitability and currents through K<sub>V</sub>7 channels (<italic>I</italic><sub>M</sub>) or TRPV<sub>1</sub> channels (<italic>I</italic><sub>caps</sub>) of DRG neurons were determined in the perforated patch clamp mode, voltage-activated Ca<sup>2+</sup> currents in the whole-cell configuration. Signals were low-pass filtered at 5 kHz, digitized at 10 to 50 kHz, and stored on an IBM-compatible computer. Traces were analyzed off-line by the Clampfit 8.2 program (Molecular Devices). Patch electrodes were pulled (Flaming-Brown puller, Sutter Instruments, Novato, CA) from borosilicate glass capillaries (Science Products, Frankfurt/Main, Germany). For perforated patch recordings, the internal solution contained (mM) K<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub> (75), KCl (55), MgCl<sub>2</sub> (8), and HEPES (10), adjusted to pH 7.3 with KOH; the recording electrodes were first front-filled with this internal solution and then back-filled with the same solution containing 200 μg/mL amphotericin B (in 0.8% dimethylsulfoxide [DMSO]). For whole-cell recordings, the pipette solution consisted of (mM) CsCl (130), tetraethylammonium chloride (20), CaCl<sub>2</sub> (0.24), glucose (10), HEPES (10), EGTA (5), Mg-ATP (2), and Na-GTP (2), adjusted to pH 7.3 with CsOH. The external (bathing) solution routinely contained (mM) NaCl (140), KCl (6.0), CaCl<sub>2</sub> (2.0), MgCl<sub>2</sub> (2.0), glucose (20), HEPES (10), adjusted to pH 7.4 with NaOH. For the recordings of <italic>I</italic><sub>M</sub> and <italic>I</italic><sub>caps</sub>, TTX (0.5 μM) was included to suppress voltage-activated Na<sup>+</sup> currents. For Ca<sup>2+</sup> current recordings, the external solution contained (mM) tetraethylammonium chloride (155), MgCl<sub>2</sub> (0.8), CaCl<sub>2</sub> (2.5), glucose (11), HEPES (10), and TTX (0.0005), adjusted to pH 7.3 with KOH. Tip resistances were between 1.5 and 3.5 MΩ. The resulting liquid junction potentials were below ±10 mV and were not taken into further consideration during experimentation or data evaluation. Drugs were applied via a DAD-12 drug application device (Adams &amp; List, Westbury, NY), which permits a complete exchange of solutions surrounding the cells being investigated within less than 100 ms <xref rid="b0025" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>.</p>
        <p>To test for the effects of different nucleotides on membrane excitability, DRG neurons were challenged by 5 increasing current injections (0.1 to 0.5 nA), each lasting for 2 seconds. Changes in excitability were evaluated by counting the number of action potentials fired during these 5 current injections in the absence and presence of nucleotides, respectively.</p>
        <p>To quantify currents through K<sub>V</sub>7 channels (<italic>I</italic><sub>M</sub>), noninactivating outward currents were activated by depolarizing the membrane to −30 mV. Once every 10 seconds, cells were hyperpolarized to −55 mV for 1-second periods to deactivate K<sub>V</sub>7 channels; the differences between current amplitudes 20 ms after the onset of hyperpolarisations and 20 ms before re-depolarization were taken as a measure for <italic>I</italic><sub>M</sub> <xref rid="b0030" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>. Currents through TRPV<sub>1</sub> channels were evoked by 15-second applications of capsaicin (<italic>I</italic><sub>caps</sub>) to cells held at a potential of −70 mV once every 2 minutes, and the peak amplitudes of these currents were quantified. Ca<sup>2+</sup> currents were elicited by 30-ms depolarizations from a holding potential of −80 to −10 mV at a frequency of 4 per minute. Leakage currents were corrected for by an online leak subtraction protocol that applies 4 hyperpolarizing pulses before the depolarization to −10 mV; currents were quantified by measuring peak current amplitudes.</p>
        <p>Recordings obtained in the presence of nucleotides (b) were compared with those measured before (a) and after (c) the presence of the nucleotides; changes in current amplitudes were then calculated as percent of control = 200 * b/(a + c) or as percent inhibition = 100 − [200 * b/(a + c)]. For statistical comparison, such sequences were recorded, but nucleotide solutions were replaced by solvent.</p>

        <title>Nucleotides increase the excitability of DRG neurons</title>
        <p>The excitability of DRG neurons is well known to be enhanced in the presence of a variety of inflammatory mediators, such as bradykinin <xref rid="b0130" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref> and prostaglandins <xref rid="b0090" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>, which results in increased action potential firing frequencies. Moreover, changes in membrane excitability of DRG neurons correlate well with changes in nocifensive behavior <xref rid="b0130" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>. Therefore, DRG neurons were investigated in perforated patch recordings (to maintain the integrity of cytosolic signaling components) in current clamp mode. To test for the excitability of the neurons, 2-second current injections were applied in increments of 100 pA as described, for instance, in investigations on the effects of prostaglandins <xref rid="b0090" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>.</p>
        <p>A total of 64 cells had an average membrane potential of −65.1 ± 0.8 mV. In response to the injection of 100 pA for 2 seconds, none of the neurons fired any action potential; with increasing current injections, however, the number of elicited action potentials increased; with 500 pA injections, for instance, the neurons fired 1.4 ± 0.1 action potentials per 2 seconds (<italic>n</italic> = 64; <xref rid="f0005" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>A). Subsequently, the total number of action potentials fired in response to all 5 current injections will be evaluated. In the presence of 10 μM ATP, the neurons were depolarized by about 10 mV, and the number of action potentials elicited by the 5 consecutive periods of current injection increased to &gt;40. After removal of ATP, the membrane potential and the number of elicited action potentials returned to the levels observed prior to the application of the nucleotide (<xref rid="f0005" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>A). Thus, ATP significantly and reversibly enhanced the excitability of DRG neurons.</p>
        <p>For comparison, 10 μM of ADP, UDP, UTP, or thio-UTP were applied to DRG neurons instead of ATP; ADP, UTP, and 2-thio-UTP caused effects equivalent to those observed for ATP, whereas UDP hardly caused any change (<xref rid="f0005" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>B). The effects of the nucleotides on both the membrane potential and the number of elicited action potentials were concentration dependent, with ATP, UTP, and thio-UTP being more potent than ADP (<xref rid="f0005" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>C and D).</p>

        <title>The effects of nucleotides are mediated by 2 separate receptors</title>
        <p>None of the cloned P2Y receptors accept ADP and UTP as agonists acting at a similar range of concentrations <xref rid="b0215" ref-type="bibr">[43]</xref>. Moreover, 2-thio-UTP is a P2Y<sub>2</sub>-preferring agonist <xref rid="b0085" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>, and ADP does not activate P2Y<sub>2</sub> <xref rid="b0215" ref-type="bibr">[43]</xref>. Therefore, we assumed that the actions of the 4 nucleotides, as described above, were mediated by at least 2 separate P2Y receptors. Because ADP is an agonist at P2Y<sub>1</sub> receptors, and these receptors are expressed in a large number of different neurons <xref rid="b0105" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>, ADP was applied together with 30 μM of the specific P2Y<sub>1</sub> antagonist MRS 2179 <xref rid="b0215" ref-type="bibr">[43]</xref>. In fact, the number of action potentials triggered by current injections in the presence of 10 μM ADP was significantly reduced by MRS 2179 (<xref rid="f0005" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>E), whereas this antagonist had no effect on the number of action potentials triggered in the presence of 10 μM 2-thio-UTP (<xref rid="f0005" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>F). Thus, ADP and 2-thio-UTP acted via different receptors. Nevertheless, the excitatory effects mediated by these 2 receptors were not additive, as the combination of ADP and 2-thio-UTP raised the number of action potential to a similar extent as the separated application of these nucleotides (<xref rid="f0005" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>G).</p>

        <p>Knowing that ADP and 2-thio-UTP elicited excitatory effects via 2 separate P2Y receptors, ADP was used first to further investigate the underlying mechanisms. In current clamp experiments, ADP (10 μM) slowly reduced nondesensitizing outward currents at holding potentials more positive than −60 mV (not shown), as previously observed in sympathetic neurons <xref rid="b0030" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>; this is indicative of an effect on K<sub>V</sub>7 channels. Therefore, the gating of these channels was assessed by applying hyperpolarizing voltage steps from a holding potential of −30 mV where K<sub>V</sub>7 channels are open to −55 mV in order to close the channels (<xref rid="f0010" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>A). ADP (10 μM) slowly reduced the holding currents at −30 mV as well as the slow deactivation of the current through K<sub>V</sub>7 channels (M current; <italic>I</italic><sub>M</sub>) as observed at −55 mV (<xref rid="f0010" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>A). The reduction of outward currents at −30 mV by ADP reached a maximum after 30 seconds, and these currents returned to control values within 1 minute after removal of the nucleotide (<xref rid="f0010" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>B). This effect was also seen with 10 μM ATP and UTP, as well as with 10 μM of the selective P2Y<sub>2</sub> agonist 2-thio-UTP (<xref rid="f0010" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>C). In concentration-response curves for the inhibition of <italic>I</italic><sub>M</sub>, ATP turned out to be more potent than ADP, UTP, and 2-thio-UTP (<xref rid="f0010" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>E).</p>
        <p>At least ATP might also induce inward currents in DRG neurons through an activation of P2X receptors. To reveal whether P2X might be involved in the slow induction of apparent inward currents as observed at −30 mV (<xref rid="f0010" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>B), the nucleotides were also applied to neurons clamped at −70 mV where K<sub>V</sub>7 channels are entirely inactivated <xref rid="b0050" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>. Under these conditions, ATP, but not ADP, UTP, nor 2-thio-UTP (each at a concentration of 10 μM), caused rapidly activating inward currents that reached maximal amplitudes within ⩽100 ms and largely desensitized within the next 2 seconds (<xref rid="s0095" ref-type="sec">Supplementary Fig. 1A and B</xref>). Thus, the slow effects on K<sub>V</sub>7 channels described above can be easily discerned from actions mediated by P2X receptors. Moreover, ATP did reduce <italic>I</italic><sub>M</sub> at concentrations (such as 0.1 μM; <xref rid="f0010" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>E) that were too low to activate P2X receptors (not shown).</p>
        <p>To learn whether the inhibition of K<sub>V</sub>7 channels by nucleotides is specific for nociceptive neurons, ADP and 2-thio-UTP were also applied to capsaicin-insensitive neurons. There, the reduction of <italic>I</italic><sub>M</sub> deactivation amplitudes was as pronounced as in capsaicin-sensitive neurons (compare <xref rid="f0010" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>C and D).</p>
        <p>The inhibition of <italic>I</italic><sub>M</sub> by ADP (<xref rid="f0010" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>F), but not that by 2-thio-UTP (<xref rid="f0010" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>G), was largely reduced by the P2Y<sub>1</sub> antagonist MRS 2179. Thus, 2 separate P2Y receptors mediate an inhibition of K<sub>V</sub>7 channels in sensory neurons. Nevertheless, the effects of ADP and 2-thio-UTP on <italic>I</italic><sub>M</sub> were not additive (<xref rid="f0010" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>H).</p>

        <title>Phospholipase C and increase in intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> mediate the inhibition of K<sub>V</sub>7 channels by nucleotides</title>
        <p>To investigate the underlying signaling mechanisms, ADP and 2-thio-UTP were used as agonists for the 2 different receptors. All P2Y receptors with the exception of P2Y<sub>12,13,14</sub> couple to Gq proteins and thereby to phospholipase C (PLC) <xref rid="b0215" ref-type="bibr">[43]</xref>. When DRG neurons were treated with 1 μM of the PLC inhibitor U73122 <xref rid="b0115" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref> for 15 minutes, the inhibition by either ADP or 2-thio-UTP was significantly smaller than prior to this treatment. Furthermore, treatment of the neurons with 1 μM of the Ca<sup>2+</sup>-ATPase inhibitor thapsigargin <xref rid="b0195" ref-type="bibr">[39]</xref> for 15 minutes or with 10 μM of the cell permeant Ca<sup>2+</sup>-chelator BAPTA-AM also reduced the inhibition of <italic>I</italic><sub>M</sub> by the 2 nucleotides when compared with the pretreatment situation (<xref rid="f0015" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>B and C). Thus, inhibition of PLC, depletion of intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> stores, and chelation of intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> prevented the inhibition of K<sub>V</sub>7 channels by nucleotides.</p>
        <p>The PLC-mediated synthesis of inositol trisphosphate together with increases in intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> can lead to the activation of Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent protein kinase C (PKC) isoforms that might be involved in the inhibition of K<sub>V</sub>7 channels. However, the specific PKC inhibitor GF 109203X <xref rid="b0145" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref> at a concentration of 1 μM did not alter the inhibition of K<sub>V</sub>7 channels by either ADP or 2-thio-UTP (<xref rid="f0015" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>B and C).</p>

        <title>Two separate receptors mediate a sensitization of TRPV<sub>1</sub> channels by nucleotides</title>
        <p>The sensitization of TRPV<sub>1</sub> channels by inflammatory mediators is believed to contribute to the development of chronic pain <xref rid="b0110" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>; nucleotides have been reported to cause sensitization of TRPV<sub>1</sub> <xref rid="b0200 b0155" ref-type="bibr">[40,31]</xref>. Hence, ADP and 2-thio-UTP as agonists for the 2 separate functional P2Y receptors in DRG neurons as identified above were used to reveal whether these 2 P2Y receptors might also be linked to TRPV<sub>1</sub> channels. Indeed, currents evoked by 0.3 μM capsaicin were markedly enhanced in the presence of 10 μM ADP (<xref rid="f0020" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref>A). This effect of ADP developed slowly and reached its maximum after 94.7 ± 19.5 seconds (<italic>n</italic> = 4). In concentration-response curves for capsaicin-induced currents, this enhancement was revealed to be due to a leftward shift in the presence of the nucleotide; 2-thio-UTP caused a leftward shift similar to that observed for ADP (<xref rid="f0020" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref>B). ADP and 2-thio-UTP were about equipotent in potentiating capsaicin-evoked currents with half maximal effects at around 1 μM (<xref rid="f0020" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref>C). The potentiation by ADP was attenuated in the presence of the P2Y<sub>1</sub> antagonist MRS 2179 (<xref rid="f0020" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref>D), whereas the effect of 2-thio-UTP remained unaltered (<xref rid="f0020" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref>E). Thus, the 2 separate nucleotide receptors mediating the inhibition of K<sub>V</sub>7 channels also mediated a sensitization of TRPV<sub>1</sub> channels. Moreover, the effects of ADP and 2-thio-UTP were not additive once again (<xref rid="f0020" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref>F).</p>

        <title>Phospholipase C, increases in intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup>, and protein kinase C mediate the sensitization of TRPV<sub>1</sub> channels by nucleotides</title>
        <p>TRPV<sub>1</sub> channels are believed to be tonically inhibited by phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP<sub>2</sub>), and a depletion of PIP<sub>2</sub> in the membrane thus leads to sensitization of the receptors. Alternatively, the sensitization can occur via an activation of PKC <xref rid="b0170" ref-type="bibr">[34]</xref>. To analyze the signaling cascades that link the 2 P2Y receptors to TRPV<sub>1</sub> channels, the manipulations used to investigate the inhibition of K<sub>V</sub>7 channels were used again. As observed in those experiments, inhibition of PLC by 1 μM U73122 prevented the facilitation of capsaicin-evoked currents by either ADP or 2-thio-UTP (<xref rid="f0025" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5A–C</xref>).</p>
        <p>The depletion of intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> stores by thapsigargin and the chelation of intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> by BAPTA-AM also abolished the sensitization of TRPV<sub>1</sub> channels by the nucleotides. Likewise, when PKC was inhibited by GF 109203X, the facilitation of capsaicin-evoked currents by either ADP or 2-thio-UTP was largely reduced (<xref rid="f0025" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref>B and C).</p>

        <title>The increase in the excitability of DRG neurons involves K<sub>V</sub>7 and TRPV<sub>1</sub> channels</title>
        <p>To test whether the increase in the excitability of DRG neurons observed in the presence of nucleotides is brought about by the inhibition of K<sub>V</sub>7 channels and/or by the sensitization of TRPV<sub>1</sub> channels, the nucleotides were applied together with either flupirtine, an activator of K<sub>V</sub>7 channels <xref rid="b0050" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>, XE991, an inhibitor of K<sub>V</sub>7 channels <xref rid="b0050" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>, and/or iodoresiniferatoxin, an antagonist at TRPV<sub>1</sub> channels <xref rid="b0010" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>.</p>
        <p>Flupirtine 100 μM hyperpolarized DRG neurons by about 5 mV (<xref rid="f0030" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6</xref>C), but failed to significantly reduce the small number of action potentials fired in response to the injection of depolarizing currents with increasing amplitudes (0.1 to 0.5 nA) in the absence of nucleotides (<xref rid="f0030" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6</xref>A and B). However, flupirtine entirely prevented action potential firing in the presence of either 100 μM ADP (<xref rid="f0030" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6</xref>A and B) or 10 μM 2-thio-UTP (<xref rid="f0030" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6</xref>B). In addition, flupirtine abolished the depolarizations caused by either of these 2 nucleotides (<xref rid="f0030" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6</xref>C).</p>
        <p>XE991 at 10 μM, a concentration that fully blocks currents through K<sub>V</sub>7 channels in DRG neurons <xref rid="b0130" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>, enhanced the action potential firing and caused depolarization of DRG neurons to about the same extent as ADP or 2-thio-UTP (<xref rid="f0030" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6</xref>D and E). Nevertheless, in the presence of 10 μM XE991, the 2 nucleotides were still able to further depolarize the neurons and to facilitate action potential firing (<xref rid="f0030" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6</xref>D and E).</p>
        <p>Iodoresiniferatoxin (0.3 μM), in contrast, did not alter action potential firing in the absence of nucleotides, but significantly reduced the number of action potentials fired in response to current injections in the presence of either 100 μM ADP (<xref rid="f0035" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7</xref>A and B) or 10 μM 2-thio-UTP (<xref rid="f0035" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7</xref>B). Moreover, iodoresiniferatoxin per se did not alter the membrane potential, but significantly reduced the depolarizing effect of either ADP or 2-thio-UTP (<xref rid="f0035" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7</xref>C). Finally, when applied in the continuing presence of XE991 (10 μM), iodoresiniferatoxin prevented any depolarization and any enhancement of action potential firing by either ADP or 2-thio-UTP (<xref rid="f0035" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7</xref>D and E). Thus, the blockade of K<sub>V</sub>7 channels and of TRPV<sub>1</sub> channels is sufficient to abolish the excitation of DRG neurons by nucleotides.</p>

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>Although it is firmly established that ionotropic ATP receptors containing P2X<sub>3</sub> subunits do contribute to the well-known algetic effects of this nucleotide, the role of metabotropic P2Y receptors has remained at least controversial, if not unclear <xref rid="b0220" ref-type="bibr">[44]</xref>. Here, we demonstrate that activation of both P2Y<sub>1</sub> and P2Y<sub>2</sub> receptors leads to a marked increase in the excitability of DRG neurons; such an increase in membrane excitability in DRG neurons is a cellular correlate of enhanced nociceptive behavior <xref rid="b0055 b0130" ref-type="bibr">[11,26]</xref>. Furthermore, the results reveal that both an inhibition of K<sub>V</sub>7 channels and a potentiation of TRPV<sub>1</sub> channels are involved in the excitation of DRG neurons via these 2 nucleotide receptors. The same signaling mechanisms are involved in the excitatory actions of bradykinin in DRG neurons <xref rid="b0055 b0130 b0230" ref-type="bibr">[11,26,46]</xref>.</p>
      <p>ADP, ATP, UTP, and 2-thio-UTP enhanced action potential firing in response to current injections with the following order of agonist potency: ATP = UTP = 2-thio-UTP &gt; ADP. ADP is an agonist at P2Y<sub>1,12,13</sub> receptors <xref rid="b0215" ref-type="bibr">[43]</xref>, and the effects of ADP were largely attenuated by the selective P2Y<sub>1</sub> receptor antagonist MRS 2179 <xref rid="b0070" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>, which demonstrates the participation of this latter receptor. The other nucleotides used are either poor or not at all agonists at P2Y<sub>1</sub> receptors <xref rid="b0215" ref-type="bibr">[43]</xref>. Hence, another nucleotide receptor must have contributed, and this was P2Y<sub>2</sub> for the following reasons: (1) UDP did not mimic the effects of UTP; thus, a role of P2Y<sub>6</sub> can be excluded <xref rid="b0215" ref-type="bibr">[43]</xref>. (2) ATP and UTP were about equipotent as observed for rat P2Y<sub>2</sub> and P2Y<sub>4</sub> receptors <xref rid="b0215" ref-type="bibr">[43]</xref>. (3) UTP and 2-thio-UTP were equipotent; this only holds true for P2Y<sub>2</sub>, but not for P2Y<sub>4</sub> receptors <xref rid="b0085" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>. Thus, the nucleotides enhanced the excitability of DRG neurons via both P2Y<sub>1</sub> and P2Y<sub>2</sub> receptors.</p>
      <p>Recombinant P2Y<sub>1,2,4,6</sub> receptors mediate an inhibition of K<sub>V</sub>7 channels <xref rid="b0035" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>, and DRG neurons express K<sub>V</sub>7.2, K<sub>V</sub>7.3, and K<sub>V</sub>7.5 <xref rid="b0050" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>. Most recently, acute nociception induced by bradykinin was shown to involve inhibition of K<sub>V</sub>7 channels and activation of a Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent chloride current <xref rid="b0130" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>. Here, all the nucleotides mentioned above reduced currents through K<sub>V</sub>7 channels, and the action of ADP, but not that of 2-thio-UTP, was attenuated by the P2Y<sub>1</sub> antagonist MRS 2179. Thus, the activation of both P2Y<sub>1</sub> and P2Y<sub>2</sub> receptors contributed to the closure of K<sub>V</sub>7 channels. However, we found no evidence for an induction of chloride currents by any of the nucleotides tested (not shown). The inhibition of K<sub>V</sub>7 channels by both P2Y<sub>1</sub> and P2Y<sub>2</sub> has also been observed with receptors heterologously expressed in sympathetic neurons <xref rid="b0045" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>.</p>
      <p>TRPV<sub>1</sub> channels mediate acute and chronic pain <xref rid="b0110" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>, and ADP as well as 2-thio-UTP enhanced currents through these receptors; this effect of ADP, but not that of 2-thio-UTP, was again antagonized by MRS 2179. Hence, in contrast to what has been indicated by previous experiments, it is not P2Y<sub>1</sub> <xref rid="b0200" ref-type="bibr">[40]</xref> or P2Y<sub>2</sub> <xref rid="b0155 b0135" ref-type="bibr">[31,27]</xref>, but both receptors that contribute to the sensitization of TRPV<sub>1</sub> channels by nucleotides. The most likely reason for the conflicting interpretations of previous results is the fact that a full range of selective agonists and antagonists for these 2 receptors as employed here had not been used. Alternatively, the reason might be species differences between rats and mice.</p>
      <p>Both P2Y<sub>1</sub> and P2Y<sub>2</sub> receptors are linked to Gq proteins and thereby to PLC <xref rid="b0215" ref-type="bibr">[43]</xref>. In accordance with this, the PLC inhibitor U73122 <xref rid="b0115" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref> prevented the effects of both ADP and 2-thio-UTP, on K<sub>V</sub>7 channels as well as on TRPV<sub>1</sub> channels. The actions of these nucleotides on K<sub>V</sub>7 and TRPV<sub>1</sub> channels were also abolished when Ca<sup>2+</sup>-ATPases had been inhibited by thapsigargin <xref rid="b0195" ref-type="bibr">[39]</xref> or when intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> had been chelated by BAPTA-AM; thus, increases in intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> were involved in both of these effects. Downstream of Ca<sup>2+</sup>, however, the signaling cascades linking the 2 P2Y receptors to either K<sub>V</sub>7 channels or TRPV<sub>1</sub> channels differed from each other: the sensitization of TRPV<sub>1</sub> channels was mediated by an activation of protein kinase C, as indicated by the inhibitory effect of GF 109203X, whereas the inhibition of K<sub>V</sub>7 channels was not altered by this PKC inhibitor. This bifurcated signaling pathway was shared by both receptors, P2Y<sub>1</sub> and P2Y<sub>2</sub>. As a consequence, the simultaneous activation of both receptors by ADP and 2-thio-UTP did not achieve larger effects than the activation of only one of these receptors.</p>
      <p>These results lead to the question of how P2Y receptor activation could modulate K<sub>V</sub>7 channels, on one hand, and TRPV<sub>1</sub> channels, on the other hand. The inhibition of neuronal K<sub>V</sub>7 channels by G-protein coupled receptors involves either depletion of membrane PIP<sub>2</sub>, phosphorylation via PKC, or binding of intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> to channel-bound calmodulin. In sympathetic neurons, the first 2 mechanisms were shown to mediate K<sub>V</sub>7 channel inhibition via M<sub>1</sub> muscarinic receptors <xref rid="b0080" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>; the latter mechanism has been found to mediate the inhibition via bradykinin and P2Y receptors <xref rid="b0040 b0245" ref-type="bibr">[8,49]</xref>. The present results support this latter idea, as manipulations that prevented increases in intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> abolished the effects of nucleotides on K<sub>V</sub>7 channels, but inhibition of PKC failed to alter the effect of P2Y receptor activation.</p>
      <p>Obviously, the facilitation of currents through TRPV<sub>1</sub> channels via P2Y receptors cannot involve Ca<sup>2+</sup>/calmodulin, as this signaling entity, if anything, mediates the desensitization of TRPV<sub>1</sub>, but not a sensitization <xref rid="b0170" ref-type="bibr">[34]</xref>. However, PLC-mediated depletion of membrane PIP<sub>2</sub> <xref rid="b0075" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref> as well as activation of Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent PKC <xref rid="b0210" ref-type="bibr">[42]</xref> are both known to potentiate currents evoked by low, but not those evoked by high, capsaicin concentrations. In accordance with both mechanisms, the nucleotides caused a leftward shift in the concentration-response curves of capsaicin-evoked currents. However, the fact that prevention of increases in intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> as well as inhibition of PKC abolished the sensitization of TRPV<sub>1</sub> channels by ADP or 2-thio-UTP demonstrate a role of Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent PKC.</p>
      <p>Because this latter result proves that activation of either P2Y<sub>1</sub> or P2Y<sub>2</sub> leads to the activation of Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent PKC, which then phosphorylates TRPV<sub>1</sub>, one has to ask why activated PKC did not contribute to the inhibition of K<sub>V</sub>7 channels as previously reported for the signaling cascade linking M<sub>1</sub> muscarinic receptors to this ion channel family <xref rid="b0080" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>. The most likely explanation is offered by the finding that Ca<sup>2+</sup>/calmodulin disrupts the association of K<sub>V</sub>7 channels and AKAP79/150, which is a prerequisite for the phosphorylation of K<sub>V</sub>7 channels by PKC <xref rid="b0015" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>.</p>
      <p>The increase in action potential firing in the presence of ADP or 2-thio-UTP was completely abolished in the presence of the nonopioid analgesic flupirtine, which is known to activate K<sub>V</sub>7 channels <xref rid="b0225" ref-type="bibr">[45]</xref>. This appears to indicate that the entire increase in excitability was mediated by the inhibition of the K<sup>+</sup> channels. However, the hyperpolarization of the neurons caused by flupirtine might also counteract the excitatory effects of the nucleotides independently of the interaction at K<sub>V</sub>7 channels. Hence, this set of data does not unequivocally demonstrate that K<sub>V</sub>7 channels were involved in the effects of the nucleotides on excitability and membrane potential. However, blockage of K<sub>V</sub>7 channels by XE991 depolarized DRG neurons and enhanced their excitability to a similar extent as the activation of the 2 nucleotide receptors; this verifies that the closure of K<sub>V</sub>7 channels is sufficient to depolarize DRG neurons and to enhance their excitability.</p>
      <p>Nevertheless, the excitatory actions of ADP or 2-thio-UTP were additive to that of XE991, which hints to a role of an additional mechanism. In line with this conclusion, the TRPV<sub>1</sub> antagonist iodoresiniferatoxin also attenuated the nucleotide-induced increase in membrane excitability. Moreover, the effects of the nucleotides on action potential firing and membrane potential in the presence of XE991 were entirely abolished by iodoresiniferatoxin. Hence, the inhibition of K<sub>V</sub>7 channels as well as the sensitization of TRPV<sub>1</sub> channels both contributed to the increase in excitability triggered by the activation of either P2Y<sub>1</sub> or P2Y<sub>2</sub> receptors.</p>
      <p>In contrast to the excitatory effects shown above, ADP has been reported to elicit analgesic rather than proalgesic effects, and an inhibition of transmembrane Ca<sup>2+</sup> entry in DRG neurons was implied as underlying mechanism <xref rid="b0100" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>. The inhibition of VACCs was first suggested to be mediated by P2Y<sub>1</sub> <xref rid="b0100" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>, whereas a later report demonstrated a role of P2Y<sub>12</sub> and/or P2Y<sub>13</sub> receptors <xref rid="b0140" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref>. In accordance with that latter result, we found that the inhibition of VACCs by ADP was attenuated by the P2Y<sub>12</sub> antagonist cangrelor, but not by MRS2179. This confirms that P2Y<sub>1</sub> contributes to the sensation of pain in concert with P2Y<sub>2</sub>, whereas analgesic effects are mediated by P2Y receptors coupled to inhibitory G proteins <xref rid="b0140" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref>.</p>
      <p>Taken together, our results reveal that ATP may cause pain not only by the activation of ionotropic P2X receptors, but also via P2Y<sub>2</sub> receptors. In addition, the ATP degradation product ADP also contributes to the sensation of pain as it activates P2Y<sub>1</sub> receptors. These 2 metabotropic nucleotide receptors share a bifurcated signaling cascade to enhance the excitability of DRG neurons through a twofold mechanism: an inhibition of K<sub>V</sub>7 channels through Ca<sup>2+</sup>/calmodulin and a sensitization of TRPV<sub>1</sub> channels via Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent PKC. Because this bifurcated mechanism is also associated with bradykinin B<sub>2</sub> receptors, it may well be a general signal cascade employed by painful mediators <xref rid="b0055" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>.</p>
