      <abstract>
        <p>ERK1 and ERK2 (ERK1/2) are central to the regulation of cell division, growth and survival. They are activated by phosphorylation of the Thr- and the Tyr- residues in their Thr-Glu-Tyr activation loops. The dogma is that dually-phosphorylated ERK1/2 constitute the principal activities in intact cells. We previously showed that, in neonatal rat cardiac myocytes, endothelin-1 and phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) powerfully and rapidly (maximal at ~ 5 min) activate ERK1/2. Here, we show that dually-phosphorylated ERK1/2 rapidly (&lt; 2 min) appear in the nucleus following stimulation with endothelin-1. We characterized the active ERK1/2 species in myocytes exposed to endothelin-1 or PMA using MonoQ FPLC. Unexpectedly, two peaks of ERK1 and two peaks of ERK2 activity were resolved using <italic>in vitro</italic> kinase assays. One of each of these represented the dually-phosphorylated species. The other two represented activities for ERK1 or ERK2 which were phosphorylated solely on the Thr- residue. Monophosphothreonyl ERK1/2 represented maximally ~ 30% of total ERK1/2 activity after stimulation with endothelin-1 or PMA, and their <italic>k</italic><sub><italic>cat</italic></sub> values were estimated to be minimally ~ 30% of the dually-phosphorylated species. Appearance of monophosphothreonyl ERK1/2 was rapid but delayed in comparison with dually-phosphorylated ERK1/2. Of 10 agonists studied, endothelin-1 and PMA were most effective in terms of ERK1/2 activation and in stimulating the appearance of monophosphothreonyl and dually-phosphorylated ERK1/2. Thus, enzymically active monophosphothreonyl ERK1/2 are formed endogenously following activation of the ERK1/2 cascade and we suggest that monophosphothreonyl ERK1/2 arise by protein tyrosine phosphatase-mediated dephosphorylation of dually-phosphorylated ERK1/2.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>The related prototypic MAPKs, ERK1 and ERK2 (ERK1/2), are Pro-directed Ser-/Thr- protein kinases which regulate cell growth, division and survival through their effects on gene expression and other cellular processes 
<xref rid="bb0005 bb0010 bb0015" ref-type="bibr">[1–3]
</xref>. In many dividing cells (including cell lines), growth factor-binding to receptor protein Tyr- kinases leads to activation of ERK1/2 
<xref rid="bb0020 bb0025" ref-type="bibr">[4,5]
</xref>. This is also the case in primary cultures of (terminally-differentiated) neonatal rat cardiac myocytes 
<xref rid="bb0030 bb0035" ref-type="bibr">[6,7]
</xref> but here robust ERK1/2 activation is also induced by Gq protein-coupled receptor-/PKC-dependent pathways 
<xref rid="bb0040" ref-type="bibr">[8]
</xref>. Thus, ligands such as endothelin-1 (ET-1) and tumour-promoting phorbol esters (such as phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate, PMA) essentially stoicheiometrically activate ERK1/2 in these cells 
<xref rid="bb0035" ref-type="bibr">[7]
</xref>.</p>
      <p>ERK1/2 are the final components of a protein kinase signalling cascade in which members of the Raf MAPK kinase kinase family (Raf-1, A-Raf and B-Raf) phosphorylate and activate MAPK kinase kinases 1 and 2 (MKK1/2), which in turn phosphorylate and activate ERK1/2 
<xref rid="bb0005" ref-type="bibr">[1]
</xref>. In all 'classical' MAPKs (ERK1/2, JNKs and p38-MAPKα/β) and some 'novel' MAPKs, activation involves the phosphorylation of a Tyr- residue and a Thr- residue in the activation loop Thr-Xaa-Tyr sequence (Thr-Glu-Tyr in ERK1/2) to produce the dually-phosphorylated MAPK species 
<xref rid="bb0005" ref-type="bibr">[1]
</xref>. In mouse or rat, the relevant residues are Thr-203 and Tyr-205 in ERK1, and Thr-183 and Tyr-185 in ERK2. The general belief is that phosphorylation of both Tyr- and Thr- is necessary for activation of ERK1/2.</p>
      <p>Activated ERK1 and ERK2 from cardiac myocytes exposed to ET-1 or PMA have been separated into two discrete peaks of activity by MonoQ Fast Protein Liquid Chromatography (FPLC) with ERK2 eluting at a lower NaCl concentration 
<xref rid="bb0030 bb0045" ref-type="bibr">[6,9]
</xref>. We show here that each of these peaks of ERK1 or ERK2 activity can be resolved further into two separate peaks. One of these two resolved peaks of ERK1 or ERK2 is dually-phosphorylated [(pT-E-pY)ERK1/2], whereas the second peak is ERK1 or ERK2 monophosphosphorylated on the Thr- residue [(pT-E-Y)ERK1/2]. The important conclusion is that monophosphothreonyl-ERK1/2 can be formed endogenously in cells and contribute significantly to overall ERK1/2 activity.</p>

        <title>Cardiac myocyte isolation and culture</title>
        <p>Primary cultures of ventricular cardiac myocytes were prepared from 1- to 2-day-old Sprague–Dawley rats by an adaptation of the method of Iwaki et al. 
<xref rid="bb0055" ref-type="bibr">[11]

<xref rid="bb0060" ref-type="bibr">[12]
</xref>. Hearts were removed, ventricles were dissected away from atria, and ventricular myocytes were dissociated by serial digestion with 0.4 mg/ml collagenase and 0.6 mg/ml pancreatin in sterile digestion buffer (116 mM NaCl, 20 mM HEPES, 0.8 mM Na<sub>2</sub>HPO<sub>4</sub>, 5.6 mM glucose, 5.4 mM KCl and 0.8 mM MgSO<sub>4</sub>, pH 7.35). The first digestion supernatant (5 min, 37 °C, 160 cycles/min in a shaking water bath) was removed and discarded. Cell suspensions from subsequent digestions (20 min, 2 × 25 min, 20 min, 10 min; 37 °C, 136 cycles/min shaking) were recovered by centrifugation (5 min, 60 × <italic>g</italic>) and the cell pellets resuspended in plating medium [Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/medium 199 (4:1 v/v), 15% (v/v) foetal calf serum, 100 units/ml of both penicillin and streptomycin]. The cells were pre-plated on plastic Primaria tissue culture dishes (30 min). The non-cardiomyocytes adhere to the dishes whereas the cardiac myocytes remain unattached. For biochemistry experiments, the non-adherent viable cardiac myocytes from the pre-plates were plated at a density of 4 × 10<sup>6</sup> cells/dish on 60 mm Primaria dishes pre-coated at room temperature with sterile 1% (w/v) gelatin (Sigma-Aldrich UK). For immunostaining experiments, cardiac myocytes were plated at 2 × 10<sup>6</sup> cells/dish on 35 mm Primaria dishes containing glass coverslips pre-coated with gelatin as above followed by laminin (Sigma-Aldrich UK, 20 μg/ml in PBS). After 18 h, myocytes were confluent and beating spontaneously. Unless they were to be infected with adenovirus (AdV), serum was then withdrawn and myocytes were incubated in maintenance medium [Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/medium 199 (4:1 (v/v), 100 units/ml of both penicillin and streptomycin] for a further 24 h.</p>

        <title>Immunofluorescence microscopy</title>
        <p>Cardiac myocytes were exposed to ET-1 (100 nM), then washed 3× with PBS and fixed in 4% (v/v) formaldehyde (10 min, room temperature). Following permeabilisation with 0.1% (v/v) Triton X-100 (10 min, room temperature), non-specific binding was blocked with 2.5% (w/v) bovine serum albumin in 0.1% (v/v) Triton X-100 (10 min, room temperature). Antibodies and fluorophores were diluted in PBS, all incubations were at 37 °C, and coverslips were washed three times in PBS after each stage of the immunostaining procedure. Myocytes were stained with mouse primary monoclonal antibodies to (pT-E-pY)ERKs (Sigma M9692) (1:80, 60 min) and Alexa Fluor®488-conjugated secondary antibodies (1:200, 60 min). Myofilamentous actin was counterstained with Texas Red-phalloidin (5 U/ml, 20 min) and nuclei were counterstained with Hoechst 33258 (10 μg/ml, 15 min). Fluorescence microscopy was performed using a Zeiss Axio Observer Z1 inverted microscope equipped with a Zeiss LSM710 confocal imaging system, and using a Plan-Apochromat 63×/1.4 oil-immersion objective. Standard excitation and emission presets were chosen for Hoechst 33258, Alexa 488, and Texas Red dyes, which were imaged sequentially to eliminate fluorescence bleed-through. All fields were captured at a resolution of 512 × 512 pixels using a zoom factor of 1.2× with a field dimension of 112 × 112 μm.</p>

        <title>AdV vector for FLAG-ERK2</title>
        <p>The AdV-FLAG-ERK2 vector was prepared using the AdEasy™ XL Adenoviral Vector System (Stratagene) using the general methodology described previously 
<xref rid="bb0065" ref-type="bibr">[13]
</xref>. The FLAG sequence (placed 3′ to an initiation codon) was introduced into the pShuttle-CMV vector and the mouse ERK2 coding sequence was placed in frame and 3′ to the FLAG tag. The FLAG sequence was first introduced between the BglII and KpnI restriction sites in the multiple cloning site of the pShuttle-CMV vector by synthesis of an oligonucleotide cassette containing the FLAG sequence preceded by an ATG start codon. The complementary oligonucleotides used were:
<def-list><def-item><term>Forward</term><def><p>5′-GATCTACCATG<underline><bold>GACTACAAAGACGATGACGACAAG</bold></underline>GGTACCGTCGACGC-3′;</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>Reverse</term><def><p>5′-GGCCGCGTCGACGGTACC<underline><italic>CTTGTCGTCATCGTCTTTGTAGTC</italic></underline>CATGGTA-3′</p></def></def-item></def-list></p>
        <p>with the FLAG sequence underlined and emboldened, and its antisense complement underlined and italicized. The oligonucleotides were annealed and phosphorylated, resulting in a cassette flanked by 'cut' BglII and NotI sites, which was then inserted into the corresponding restriction sites in the multiple cloning site of pShuttle-CMV. This strategy, which replaces the KpnI–NotI fragment of pShuttle-CMV with an identical sequence in the cassette insert, was used to avoid the potential difficulty of cutting both the BglII and KpnI sites which lie immediately adjacent to each other in pShuttle-CMV. The mouse ERK2 coding sequence was amplified from a glutathione-<italic>S</italic>-transferase-ERK2 fusion construct in pGEX4T-1 (gift of Professor Chris Marshall, Institute of Cancer Research, London) with Pfu polymerase using forward primer: (5′-GACGACAAG<underline><bold>GGTACC</bold></underline>ATGGCGGCCGCAGCAGCGGCCGGC-3′) and reverse primer (5′-CTTATCTAG<underline><bold>AAGCTT</bold></underline>TTAAGATCTGTATCCTGGCTGGAATCTAGCAG-3′) to produce ERK2 flanked by KpnI and HindIII sites (underlined and emboldened) which were then used for insertion into the corresponding sites in FLAG-pShuttle-CMV, 3′ and in frame with the FLAG sequence. All constructs were sequenced on an ABI3730xl or ABI3130xl automated fluorescent DNA sequencer at the Clinical Sciences Centre Genomics Core Laboratory (Imperial College London). Shuttle plasmids containing verified sequences were then linearised with PmeI and used to transform BJ5183-AD-1 cells which were subsequently screened for homologous recombination. AdV plasmids from positive recombinants were expanded in XL10Gold cells, linearised with PacI and used to transform HEK293 cells, as described in the AdEasy XL Adenoviral Vector System manual. Viruses were amplified through subsequent re-infection of HEK293 cells. Serum was withdrawn from cardiac myocytes 6 h before AdV.FLAG-ERK2 infections. The multiplicity of infection was titrated to give about 10-fold greater expression of FLAG-ERK2 over endogenous ERK2 at 20 h after infection.</p>

        <title>MonoQ FPLC</title>
        <p>After the various treatments, cardiac myocytes were washed 3× with ice-cold PBS, scraped into 150 μl Buffer A [20 mM β-glycerophosphate (pH 7.5), 50 mM NaF, 2 mM EDTA, 0.004 mM microcystin LR, 1% (v/v) Triton X-100, 5 mM dithiothreitol, 10 mM benzamidine, 0.2 mM leupeptin, 0.01 mM trans-epoxy succinyl-l-leucylamido-(4-guanidino)butane, 0.3 mM phenylmethylsulphonyl fluoride], and extracts were clarified by centrifugation (10,000 × <italic>g</italic>, 5 min, 4 °C). Extracts from 4 dishes of uninfected cardiac myocytes or from 2 dishes of AdV.FLAG-ERK2 infected myocytes were loaded onto a MonoQ HR 5/5 FPLC column and ERK1/2 activities were separated using an Äkta™ FPLC system (GE Healthcare). The column was equilibrated with Buffer B (50 mM Tris/HCl pH 7.3, 2 mM EDTA, 2 mM EGTA, 0.1% (v/v) 2-mercaptoethanol, 5% (v/v) glycerol, 0.03% (v/v) Brij-35, 0.3 mM Na<sub>3</sub>VO<sub>4</sub>, 1 mM benzamidine and 4 μg/ml leupeptin). Following a 5 ml isocratic wash, discontinuous linear NaCl gradients were formed by mixing Buffer B with Buffer C (Buffer B containing 1 M NaCl) as described in the figure legends.</p>

        <p>MonoQ FPLC fractions or whole cell supernatant extracts were denatured by heating at 100 °C with 0.33 vol. sodium dodecyl sulphate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) sample buffer [300 mM Tris–HCl pH 6.8, 10% SDS (w/v), 13% glycerol (v/v), 130 mM dithiothreitol, 0.2% bromophenol blue (w/v)]. Proteins (25 μl in sample buffer) were separated by SDS-PAGE [10% (w/v) resolving gels with 6% (w/v) stacking gel] and transferred electrophoretically to nitrocellulose.

Blots were incubated with primary antibodies in TBST buffer containing 5% (w/v) bovine serum albumin overnight at 4 °C.

The blots were washed with TBST buffer (3 × 5 min, room temperature), incubated with secondary antibodies (1:5000 dilution in TBST buffer containing 1% (w/v) nonfat milk powder, 1 h, room temperature) and then washed again in TBST buffer (3 × 5 min, room temperature). Bands were detected by enhanced chemiluminescence (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) using Hyperfilm MP and were quantified by scanning densitometry.</p>

        <title>Measurement of ERK1/2 activities</title>
        <p>ERK1/2 activities in FPLC fractions (40 μl sampled) were measured by incorporation of <sup>32</sup>P from 0.1 mM [γ-<sup>32</sup>P]ATP (0.5 μCi per assay) into myelin basic protein (MBP, Upstate, 15 μg per assay) in the presence of 20 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>/2 μM protein kinase A inhibitor (Calbiochem). Assays (50 μl final volume) were initiated with 5 μl of 1 mM [γ-<sup>32</sup>P]ATP/200 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, incubated at 30 °C for 30 min, and terminated by sampling (40 μl) onto P81 paper squares which were then washed in 75 mM H<sub>3</sub>PO<sub>4</sub> (4 × 15 min) on a rocking platform. Radioactivity was measured by Čerenkov radiation counting.</p>
        <p>In some cases, ERK1/2 activities were examined by 'in-gel' MBP kinase assays. Fractions from FPLC were denatured with SDS-PAGE sample buffer and subjected to SDS-PAGE in 10% polyacrylamide gels containing 0.5 mg/ml MBP incorporated covalently into the gel matrix. After electrophoresis, SDS was removed from the gel by washing (3 × 20 min) with 20% (v/v) 2-propanol in 50 mM Tris/HCl, pH 8.0, then in 5 mM 2-mercaptoethanol in 50 mM Tris/HC1, pH 8.0 (3 × 20 min). Proteins were further denatured by washing the gel in 6 M guanidine HCl in 50 mM Tris/HC1 pH 8.0/5 mM 2-mercaptoethanol (2 × 20 min), then renatured by extensive washing in 50 mM Tris/HCl, pH 8.0, containing 0.04% (v/v) Tween-40 and 5 mM mercaptoethanol at 4 °C. After pre-incubation of the gel at 20 °C for 1 h in 40 mM HEPES, 2 mM dithiothreitol, 10 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, pH 8.0, <italic>in situ</italic> phosphorylation of MBP was performed in 40 mM HEPES, 0.5 mM EGTA, 10 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 2 μM protein kinase A inhibitor, 0.1 mM [γ-<sup>32</sup>P]ATP, pH 8.0 (5 ml/gel, containing 12.5 μCi [γ-<sup>32</sup>P]ATP) at room temperature for 3 h. After extensive washing in 5% (w/v) trichloroacetic acid/1% (w/v) sodium pyrophosphate, gels were dried and autoradiographed.</p>

        <title>MonoQ FPLC of extracts of cardiac myocytes exposed to ET-1 or PMA</title>
        <p>By reducing the flow rate and using a shallow NaCl gradient, we separated five peaks of MBP kinase activity (peak A and peaks I–IV) in extracts of cardiac myocytes exposed for 5 min to 100 nM ET-1 (

<xref rid="bb0035 bb0045" ref-type="bibr">[7,9]
</xref>. Activities in Peaks I–IV with ET-1 or PMA were about 6-fold greater than in the controls. PD184352 is an allosteric inhibitor of MKK1/2 
<xref rid="bb0070" ref-type="bibr">[14]
</xref>. Exposure of cardiac myocytes to PD184352 (2 μM, 15 min) reduced MBP kinase activities to below control values and prevented subsequent activation of MBP kinase peaks I–IV by ET-1 (
<xref rid="f0010" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2
</xref>C). These results, together with previous findings 
<xref rid="bb0030 bb0045" ref-type="bibr">[6,9]
</xref>, suggest that the MBP kinase activities in Peaks I–IV represent either ERK1 and ERK2 themselves, or that one or more of the activities represents downstream effector protein kinases activated by ERK1/2.</p>
        <p>The MonoQ fractions in 
<xref rid="f0010" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2
</xref>A,B, were immunoblotted for total (i.e. phosphorylated + non-phosphorylated) ERK1/2 (
<xref rid="f0010" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2
</xref>D). In extracts from control cells, 42 kDa ERK2 eluted over fractions 16-22 (maximal in fractions 18–19) and 44 kDa ERK1 eluted over fractions 24–29 (maximal in fractions 26–27) (
<xref rid="f0010" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2
</xref>D). In extracts of cells exposed to ET-1 or PMA, ERK1 and ERK2 eluted at slightly higher NaCl concentrations because of the negative charges introduced by phosphorylation. MBP kinases (
<xref rid="f0010" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2
</xref>A,B) in Peak I (peak fractions 19–20 eluting at ~ 0.14 M NaCl) and Peak II (peak fractions 23–24 eluting at ~ 0.16 M NaCl) contained ERK2 (
<xref rid="f0010" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2
</xref>D). Peak III (peak fractions 29–30 eluting at ~ 0.17 M NaCl, and overlapping with Peak II) contained ERK1 as did Peak IV (peak fractions 40–41 eluting at ~ 0.20 M NaCl) (
<xref rid="f0010" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2
</xref>A,B,D).</p>
        <p>Selected fractions were immunoblotted with antibodies recognising various phosphorylated forms of ERK1/2. In extracts of myocytes exposed to ET-1 or PMA, antibodies recognising (pT-E-pY)ERK1/2 showed that Peak II (fractions 23 and 25) contained (pT-E-pY)ERK2 and Peak IV (fraction 41) contained (pT-E-pY)ERK1 (
<xref rid="f0010" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2
</xref>E). Monoclonal antibodies selective for (pT-E-Y)ERK1/2 
<xref rid="bb0050" ref-type="bibr">[10]
</xref> showed that Peak I (fractions 18 and 20) contained (pT-E-Y)ERK2 and Peak III (fractions 28 and 30) contained (pT-E-Y)ERK1 (
<xref rid="f0010" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2
</xref>E). The (T-E-pY)ERK1/2-selective antibody 
<xref rid="bb0050" ref-type="bibr">[10]
</xref> did not detect any significant immunoreactivity in Peaks I–IV, though it may have detected some immunoreactivity in Peak A (fraction 7) (
<xref rid="f0010" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2
</xref>E). We cannot definitely exclude the possibility that there is some formation of (T-E-pY)ERK1/2 because the antibody may simply be unable to detect it, but we were unable to detect any signal using a variety of dilutions. Our interpretation of these experiments is that, in addition to (pT-E-pY)ERK1/2, (pT-E-Y)ERK1/2 can be readily detected in cardiac myocytes exposed to ET-1 or PMA in intact cells and these species are enzymically active.</p>
        <p>In addition to ERK1/2, a 46 kDa 'ERK' protein was detected in fractions 6–7 and which corresponded to the MBP kinase activity in Peak A eluting at ~ 0.11 M NaCl (
<xref rid="f0010" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2
</xref>A,B). This may be ERK1b, identified previously in Rat1 cells, which is expressed in highest abundance in heart 
<xref rid="bb0075" ref-type="bibr">[15]

<xref rid="bb0075" ref-type="bibr">[15]
</xref>. In comparison with peaks I–IV, Peak A MBP kinase was relatively poorly activated (~ 2-fold) by ET-1 (

        <p>We also performed 'in-gel' MBP kinase assays 
<xref rid="bb0035" ref-type="bibr">[7]

        <p>Integration of the curves in 
<xref rid="f0010" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2
</xref>A,B, showed that the enzymic activity attributable to (pT-E-Y)ERK1/2 is considerable and represents ~ 30% of the total MBP kinase activity in cardiac myocytes exposed to 100 nM ET-1 (9 separate preparations of cardiac myocytes) or 1 μM PMA for 5 min (5 separate preparations of myocytes).</p>
        <p>Approximate relative specific activities (turnover numbers or <italic>k</italic><sub><italic>cat</italic></sub>) of (pT-E-Y)ERK1/2 and (pT-E-pY)ERK1/2 were estimated from data in 
<xref rid="f0010" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2
</xref>A,B,E on the following basis. In extracts of control cardiac myocytes, antibodies against total ERK1/2 or any of the phospho-ERK1/2 species did not detect significant immunoreactivity in fractions 23 and 41. On activation of ERK1/2 by ET-1 or PMA, immunoreactivity became detectable with antibodies against total ERK1/2 or (pT-E-pY)ERK1/2, but not (pT-E-Y)ERK1/2, in fractions 23 (ERK2) and 41 (ERK1). Thus, essentially all enzymic activity and total immunoreactivity in these fractions was attributable to (pT-E-pY)ERK1/2. The ratio of measured enzymic activity to total ERK1/2 in fractions 23 and 41 thus provided a measure of the specific activity for (pT-E-pY)ERK1/2.</p>
        <p>For fractions 20 and 30, antibodies against total ERK1/2 detected immunoreactivity but negligible enzymic activity in control incubations of cardiac myocytes. However, both immunoreactivity and significant enzymic activity were detected in cardiac myocytes exposed to ET-1 or PMA but (pT-E-Y)ERK1/2 were the only phosphorylated species detectable. The ratio of measured enzymic activity to total ERK1/2 in fractions 20 and 30 thus provided a <italic>minimum</italic> measure of the specific activity for (pT-E-Y)ERK1/2 because the contribution of inactive ERK1/2 to the denominator cannot be assessed. From the data shown, the minimum specific activities (mean ± S.E., n = 5) of (pT-E-Y)ERK1 and (pT-E-Y)ERK2 were calculated to be 29 ± 1% and 30 ± 2% of those of (pT-E-pY)ERK1 and (pT-E-pY)ERK2, respectively.</p>

        <title>Infection of cardiac myocytes with AdV.FLAG-ERK2</title>
        <p>In order to ensure that activities in Peaks I and III (
<xref rid="f0010" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2
</xref>A,B) were not MBP kinases activated downstream from ERK1/2, we infected cardiac myocytes with AdV.FLAG-ERK2. Infected and uninfected myocytes were exposed to 100 nM ET-1 (5 min) and MBP kinase activities measured following MonoQ FPLC. The additional negative charge of the FLAG epitope shifted the elution of FLAG-ERK2 activity to a position between Peaks III and IV (
<xref rid="f0015" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3
</xref>A). Treatment of AdV.FLAG-ERK2-infected myocytes with ET-1 resulted in a large increase in MBP kinase activity in fractions 46–62 (note that fraction numbers in 
<xref rid="f0015" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3
</xref> are not comparable to those in 
<xref rid="f0010" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2
</xref> because fraction size was reduced). Fractions 48 (minor peak of FLAG-ERK2 activity) and 54 (major peak of FLAG-ERK2 activity) were characterised further (
<xref rid="f0015" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3
</xref>B). As expected, total ERK2 or FLAG immunoreactivity was present in much greater abundance in fractions 48 and 54 from AdV.FLAG-ERK2-infected myocytes (control or ET-1-treated) than in uninfected myocytes (
<xref rid="f0015" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3
</xref>B). (pT-E-pY)ERK1/2 were not detected in uninfected or AdV.FLAG-ERK2-infected control myocytes, though there was some (pT-E-Y)ERK1/2 immunoreactivity detectable in fraction 48 of the AdV.FLAG-ERK2-infected controls (
<xref rid="f0015" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3
</xref>B). We do not understand the reasons for this. In AdV.FLAG-ERK2-infected myocytes exposed to ET-1, a strong (pT-E-pY)ERK2 signal was detected in fraction 54 with a weaker signal in fraction 48 (
<xref rid="f0015" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3
</xref>B). Conversely, (pT-E-Y)ERK2 was readily detected in fraction 48 with a weaker signal in fraction 54 (
<xref rid="f0015" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3

        <title>Time courses of ERK1/2 phosphorylation</title>
        <p>Cardiac myocytes were exposed to 100 nM ET-1 for various times and cell extracts were immunoblotted directly with (pT-E-pY)ERK1/2 (
<xref rid="f0020" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4
</xref>A) or (pT-E-Y)ERK1/2 antibodies (
<xref rid="f0020" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4

<xref rid="f0020" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4
</xref>A), whereas (pT-E-Y)ERK1/2 were not detected before 1 min but were maximal at ~ 5 min (
<xref rid="f0020" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4
</xref>B). These findings suggest (but do not prove) a precursor–product relationship with (pT-E-Y)ERK1/2 resulting from dephosphorylation of (pT-E-pY)ERK1/2. The time course of activation of ERK1/2 by ET-1 was also examined by MonoQ FPLC (
<xref rid="f0025" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5
</xref>A). Areas under individual peaks were integrated and plotted against time (
<xref rid="f0025" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5
</xref>B). Peak II [(pT-E-pY)ERK2] and Peak IV [(pT-E-pY)ERK2] were detectable within 30 s, rose to a maximum at 1 – 2 min, then gradually declined over the subsequent 40 min (
<xref rid="f0025" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5
</xref>A,B). Peak I [(pT-E-Y)ERK2] and Peak III [(pT-E-Y)ERK1] were not detected until 1 min, then increased to a maximum at 2–5 min (Peak I) or 1–2 min (Peak III) before declining subsequently. These findings were confirmed by immunoblotting fractions containing the highest activities of Peaks I–IV (fractions 19, 23, 29 and 40, respectively) with antibodies against (pT-E-pY)ERK1/2 and (pT-E-Y)ERK1/2 (
<xref rid="f0025" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5
</xref>C). As an aside, there were two bands of total ERK2 in the 0.5–2 min samples of fraction 19 [which contains only (T-E-Y)ERK2 and (pT-E-Y)ERK2]. The more slowly migrating band is presumably (pT-E-Y)ERK2. Migration of ERK2 is reduced by phosphorylation and the result here showed that phosphorylation of the Thr- residue alone may be adequate to cause the shift.</p>

<xref rid="f0030" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6
</xref>A) and derived the relative contribution of each peak of activity to the total activity (i.e. the sum of activities in all four peaks) using activation by ET-1 (100 nM, 5 min) as an internal standard and taking it as 100%. The time of sampling was when the response to each agonist was maximal and maximally effective concentrations were chosen. In terms of total activity, ET-1 and PMA caused the greatest activation and H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> the least (
<xref rid="f0030" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6
</xref>A). Essentially the same spectrum of activation was seen for Peak II [(pT-E-pY)ERK2,

</xref>C] and Peak IV [(pT-E-pY)ERK1, 
<xref rid="f0030" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6
</xref>E], and plots of activities in these peaks against total activity relative to ET-1 were linear (<italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.0001, data not shown). However, for Peak I [(pT-E-Y)ERK2], there appeared to be a 'threshold' effect with disproportionately large effects of ET-1 and PMA relative to total activity (
<xref rid="f0030" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6
</xref>B,F). This contrasted with the other monophosphorylated species in Peak III [(pT-E-Y)ERK1,

</xref>D] where the abundance of (pT-E-Y)ERK1 was proportional to the total ERK1/2 activities (

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>Classically, activation of ERK1/2 involves phosphorylation of the Thr- and Tyr- residues in the activation loop Thr-Glu-Tyr by the dual-specificity kinases MKK1/2 in an ordered, 'distributive' manner 
<xref rid="bb0005 bb0110 bb0115 bb0120 bb0125 bb0130" ref-type="bibr">[1,22–26]
</xref>. In non-phosphorylated ERK2 (and presumably ERK1), the activation loop Tyr- lies in a hydrophobic pocket with its –OH group buried, whilst the Thr- is on the surface. First of all, Tyr-185 is phosphorylated by MKK1/2 causing a conformational change, with the phospho-Tyr- side chain moving to the surface of the protein making four interactions with two Arg- residues and thus presumably stabilising the (T-E-pY)ERK2 conformation of the enzyme. The MKK1/2 then dissociates and second MKK1/2 binds to (T-E-pY)ERK2 and phosphorylates the Thr- residue, thereby forming a further 8 ionic contacts. The Tyr- phosphorylation is important in protein substrate recognition whereas the Thr- phosphorylation improves the geometry of the active site. This model is supported by demonstration of distinct structures for the non-phosphorylated, Tyr-phosphorylated, and dually-phosphorylated forms of ERK1 
<xref rid="bb0135" ref-type="bibr">[27]
</xref>. The ordered mechanism has led to the conclusion that phosphorylation of both Thr- and Tyr- residues is essential for full activity of ERK1/2. It became generally assumed that monophosphorylated forms are, at best, low <italic>k</italic><sub>cat</sub> species and, if they occur endogenously in cells <italic>in vivo</italic>, it is only in low abundances. However, an alternative interpretation is that phosphorylation of the Tyr- is an obligatory step for stabilisation of the ‘transition state’, and that it precedes and is required for the Thr- phosphorylation. However, once the activation loop Thr- is phosphorylated, the phosphate of phospho-Tyr could be dispensable. This may explain why, although (pT-E-pY)ERK1/2 activities renatured in ‘in-gel’ kinase assays (
<xref rid="f0010" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2
</xref>F), (pT-E-Y)ERK1/2 activities did not because the Tyr-phosphorylation is necessary for renaturation.</p>
      <p>Many agonists activate ERK1/2 the ERK1/2 cascade in cardiac myocytes to varying degrees (
<xref rid="f0030" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6
</xref>) with ET-1 and PMA being most potent (as we have shown previously 
<xref rid="bb0035 bb0045" ref-type="bibr">[7,9]
</xref>). (pT-E-pY)ERK1/2 appeared rapidly (within 2 min) in both the nuclei and cytoplasm of cardiac myocytes exposed to ET-1 before declining (
<xref rid="f0005" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1
</xref>), a similar response to that seen with PMA 
<xref rid="bb0140" ref-type="bibr">[28]
</xref>. Thus, (pT-E-pY)ERK1/2 are correctly localised to regulate ET-1-mediated transcriptional events, the majority of which are dependent on activation of the ERK1/2 cascade in cardiac myocytes 
<xref rid="bb0145 bb0150" ref-type="bibr">[29,30]
</xref>. However, we were unconvinced that we could detect any production of (pT-E-Y)ERK1/2 by immunostaining (results not shown) and suggest that this is simply a problem with immunostaining with the (pT-E-Y)ERK1/2 antibody.</p>
      <p>Here, we show that (pT-E-Y)ERK1/2 can be responsible for up to ~ 30% of total ERK1/2 activity in mammalian cells (
<xref rid="f0010" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2
</xref>). To our knowledge, this is the first direct demonstration of significant <italic>endogenous</italic> (pT-E-Y)ERK1/2 activity <italic>in vivo</italic>. The general assumption has been that (pT-E-Y)ERK1/2 or (T-E-pY)ERK1/2 are essentially enzymically-inactive and that, if they do occur <italic>in vivo</italic>, they only occur in low abundances. However, <italic>in vitro</italic>, recombinant (pT-E-F)ERK2 was about 7- to 8-fold more active than (T-E-F)ERK2, though the resulting activity was still &lt; 0.5% of that of (pT-E-pY)ERK2 
<xref rid="bb0130 bb0155" ref-type="bibr">[26,31]
</xref>. Similarly, (A-E-pY)ERK2 was about 100-fold more active than (A-E-Y)ERK2 but this was only about 2% of the activity of (pT-E-pY)ERK2. However, activation loop mutants of ERK2 was used in these experiments and these may not be of strict relevance to (T-E-Y)ERK2. Zhou and Zhang

The <italic>k</italic><sub><italic>cat</italic></sub> values of (T-E-Y)ERK2, (pT-E-Y)ERK2, (T-E-pY)ERK2 and (pT-E-pY)ERK2 were 1, 227, 620 and 8940 s<sup>−1</sup>, respectively, with MBP as substrate with corresponding '<italic>K</italic>m' values of 22.9. 15.5, 15.2, and 10.0 μM. A similar rank order was obtained with, the transactivation domain of the Elk-1 transcription factor, a more 'physiological' substrate. Our estimates of the relative specific activities of (pT-E-Y)ERK1/2 to (pT-E-pY)ERK1/2 of ~ 30% are somewhat higher that the 7% of Zhou &amp; Zhang

      <p>Both (pT-E-Y)ERK1/2 and (T-E-pY)ERK1/2) have been detected by immunofluorescence or immunoblotting in intact ErbB1-overexpressing CHO cells following short-term (up to 15 min) exposure to EGF 
<xref rid="bb0050" ref-type="bibr">[10]
</xref>. They were thought to arise from selective dephosphorylation of (pT-E-pY)ERK1/2 by either PTPs or protein Ser-/Thr- phosphatases, but were assumed to be enzymically-inactive. (pT-E-Y)ERK1/2 were predominantly cytoplasmic and (T-E-pY)ERK1/2 were predominantly nuclear. Additionally, (T-E-pY)ERK1/2 formed by the action of PP2A phosphatase have been detected in the nuclei of cell lines but also co-localised with the Golgi apparatus during the G<sub>2</sub>/M phase of the cell cycle, when they may be involved in Golgi disassembly 
<xref rid="bb0165 bb0170" ref-type="bibr">[33,34]
</xref>. Their role in the Golgi seemed to be dependent on the monophosphorylation itself rather than ERK1/2 activity.</p>
      <p>Other studies using a Tyr- to Phe mutation in the T-G-Y phosphorylation motif of p38-MAPKα indicated that it can be enzymically-activated [to (pT-G-F)p38-MAPKα, etc.] by its MAPK kinase <italic>in vitro</italic>, but its activity is only ~ 5% that of (pT-G-pY)p38-MAPKα

<xref rid="bb0175" ref-type="bibr">[35]
</xref>. Largely-analogous results were obtained with mutants of the yeast p38-MAPKα orthologue HOG-1 where phosphorylation of Thr-, but not Tyr-, was essential for both catalytic and biological activity

      <p>Our data do not conflict with the accepted ordered phosphorylation mechanism. The appearance of (pT-E-Y)ERK1/2 is delayed relative to (pT-E-pY)ERK1/2 (
<xref rid="f0015" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3
</xref>), consistent with obligate initial phosphorylation of the Tyr- residue. As suggested 
<xref rid="bb0050" ref-type="bibr">[10]
</xref>, it seems likely that (pT-E-Y)ERK1/2 are generated through dephosphorylation of (pT-E-pY)ERK1/2 by one or more PTPs. On the assumption that a 'classical' Cys-dependent PTP dephosphorylates (pT-E-pY)ERK1/2, ~ 15 candidates have been identified as being expressed in cardiac myocytes by our transcriptomics data (A. Clerk, unpublished data). A final question relates to the potential role of (pT-E-Y)ERK1/2 <italic>in vivo</italic>. The biological role(s) of (pT-E-Y)ERK1/2 is unclear. Given that pY-185 in ERK2 forms part of the substrate recognition pocket, (pT-E-Y)ERK1/2 may differ from (pT-E-pY)ERK1/2 in terms of substrate specificity.</p>

        <p>MonoQ FPLC of ERK1/2 in extracts of cardiac myocytes. Myocytes were exposed to 100 nM ET-1 for 5 min, 1 μM PMA for 5 min, or to 2 μM PD184352 for 15 min followed by 100 nM ET-1 for 5 min, and extracts were applied to MonoQ columns. Following a 5 ml isocratic wash, the NaCl concentration was increased in a stepwise fashion to 0.1 M (2 ml). ERK1/2 activities were eluted with a linear NaCl gradient (0.1 M–0.22 M NaCl, 12 ml). Flow rate was 0.5 ml/min, 0.25 ml fractions were collected and MBP kinase activities measured. When shown, the broken line denotes the NaCl concentration. For the MonoQ FPLC profiles (A–C): ▲, control (A–C); ●, ET-1 (A,C) or PMA (B); ■, PD184352 pre-exposure followed by ET-1 (C). Experiments where responses to both ET-1 and PMA were examined separately but contemporaneously (A and B) were repeated on 4 different preparations of myocytes with similar results. For the effects of PD184352 (C), the experiment was repeated once with similar results. D, E. Immunoblotting of MonoQ FPLC fractions from (A) and (B). D, total (i.e. phosphorylated + non-phosphorylated) ERK1/2 was immunoblotted across the MonoQ FPLC fractions. E. Selected fractions of peak MBP kinase activity following MonoQ FPLC separations from (A) and (B) were immunoblotted for (pT-E-pY)ERK1/2 (Cell Signaling Technology Inc. antibody), (pT-E-Y)ERK1/2, (T-E-pY)ERK1/2 or total ERK1/2. F, 'in-gel' MBP kinase assays. Selected fractions containing peak MBP kinase activity following MonoQ FPLC of myocytes exposed to 100 nM ET-1 for 5 min from (A) were examined by 'in-gel' MBP kinase assays. The experiment was repeated once with similar results.</p>

        <p>Comparison of activation of ERK1 and ERK2 in cardiac myocytes by various agonists as determined by MonoQ FPLC. Myocytes were exposed to agonists at their maximally effective concentrations and times, and ERK1/2 activities in the extracts were examined using MonoQ FPLC. Agonist concentrations and lengths of exposure were: ET-1, 100 nM for 5 min (<italic>n</italic> = 8); PMA 1 μM for 5 min (<italic>n</italic> = 5); bradykinin (BK) 10 μM for 5 min (<italic>n</italic> = 3); EGF, 20 ng/ml for 5 min (<italic>n</italic> = 3); PDGF, 20 ng/ml for 5 min (<italic>n</italic> = 3); phenylephrine (PE), 100 μM for 5 min (<italic>n</italic> = 5); hyperosmotic shock (HOS) with 0.5 M sorbitol (<italic>n</italic> = 3) for 30 min; H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> 0.1 mM for 15 min (<italic>n</italic> = 3); IL-1β, 10 ng/ml for 15 min (<italic>n</italic> = 3); isoprenaline (ISO), 50 μM for 5 min (<italic>n</italic> = 3). MBP kinase activities in fractions were measured and peaks of activity were integrated. In all cases, ET-1 standards (myocytes exposed to 100 nM ET-1 for 5 min) were included, and the total activity or the activity in each peak was expressed as a percentage relative to the total activity induced by ET-1. A, total activity; B, Peak I activity [(pT-E-Y)ERK2]; C, Peak II activity [(pT-E-pY)ERK2]; D, Peak III activity, [(pT-E-Y)ERK1]; E, Peak IV activity [(pT-E-pY)ERK1]. F, G, activities in Peak I, Fig. 6B [(pT-E-Y)ERK2 relative to the ET-1 total activity standard] and Peak III, Fig. 6D [(pT-E-Y)ERK1 relative to the ET-1 total activity standard] were plotted against total activity relative to the ET-1 standard (panel A) for each agonist. All results are means ± S.E.M. F, points were fitted to a fourth-order polynomial non-linear regression equation (<italic>r</italic><sup>2</sup> = 0.98). G, points were fitted to a linear regression. In both cases, the lines were forced through the origin.</p>
