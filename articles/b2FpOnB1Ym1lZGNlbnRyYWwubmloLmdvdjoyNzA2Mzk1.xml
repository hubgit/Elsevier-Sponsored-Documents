        <title>Summary</title>
        <p>Dynein ATPases power diverse microtubule-based motilities. Each dynein motor domain comprises a ring-like head containing six AAA+ modules and N- and C-terminal regions, together with a stalk that binds microtubules. How these subdomains are arranged and generate force remains poorly understood. Here, using electron microscopy and image processing of tagged and truncated <italic>Dictyostelium</italic> cytoplasmic dynein constructs, we show that the heart of the motor is a hexameric ring of AAA+ modules, with the stalk emerging opposite the primary ATPase site (AAA1). The C-terminal region is not an integral part of the ring but spans between AAA6 and near the stalk base. The N-terminal region includes a lever-like linker whose N terminus swings by ∼17 nm during the ATPase cycle between AAA2 and the stalk base. Together with evidence of stalk tilting, which may communicate changes in microtubule binding affinity, these findings suggest a model for dynein's structure and mechanism.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>Dyneins are large motor proteins that use ATP to power movement toward the minus end of microtubules (MTs) in eukaryotes. Multiple axonemal dynein isoforms drive the beating motions of cilia and flagella (<xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">DiBella and King, 2001</xref>), whereas cytoplasmic isoforms play important roles in mitosis and trafficking of diverse cargoes within the cell (<xref rid="bib12 bib15" ref-type="bibr">Hook and Vallee, 2006; Karki and Holzbaur, 1999</xref>), including those required for the assembly of cilia and flagella (<xref rid="bib35" ref-type="bibr">Pfister et al., 2006</xref>). However, despite advances in understanding dynein's motor properties (<xref rid="bib10 bib18 bib28 bib36 bib41" ref-type="bibr">Gennerich et al., 2007; Kon et al., 2005; Mogami et al., 2007; Reck-Peterson et al., 2006; Shima et al., 2006b</xref>), the structure and mechanism of the motor remain poorly understood.</p>
      <p>Cytoplasmic dynein contains two identical heavy chains of ∼500 kDa, each of which possesses motor activity (<xref rid="bib31 bib36" ref-type="bibr">Nishiura et al., 2004; Reck-Peterson et al., 2006</xref>), together with accessory chains associated with dimerization, regulation, and cargo binding (<xref rid="bib35" ref-type="bibr">Pfister et al., 2006</xref>). The heavy chain (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>A) comprises head, stalk, and tail domains (<xref rid="bib38 bib1" ref-type="bibr">Samso et al., 1998; Burgess and Knight, 2004</xref>). The head contains six concatenated AAA+ modules (<xref rid="bib29" ref-type="bibr">Neuwald et al., 1999</xref>). AAA1 is the primary site of ATP hydrolysis, whereas AAA2–AAA4 bind nucleotide and appear to be regulatory in function (reviewed in <xref rid="bib32" ref-type="bibr">Numata et al., 2008</xref>). AAA5 and AAA6 lack nucleotide-binding motifs and are therefore thought to play a structural role. The stalk is located between AAA4 and AAA5 and is an antiparallel coiled-coil structure ending in a microtubule-binding domain (MTBD) (<xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr">Gee et al., 1997</xref>). The N-terminal tail mediates dimerization, and binds accessory chains and cargo. In axonemal dynein-c, a linker domain connects the tail and head and has been interpreted to undergo a nucleotide-dependent powerstroke, switching between two orientations relative to the head (<xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr">Burgess et al., 2003</xref>). However, structural evidence for the linker in cytoplasmic dynein is lacking. Deletion of cytoplasmic dynein's tail leaves a monomeric motor domain of ∼380 kDa (<xref rid="bib31 bib36 bib38" ref-type="bibr">Nishiura et al., 2004; Reck-Peterson et al., 2006; Samso et al., 1998</xref>), which is the subject of this study. When the motor domain is artificially dimerized, the resulting molecule can take multiple steps along MTs without detaching and thus retains processive motor function (<xref rid="bib36" ref-type="bibr">Reck-Peterson et al., 2006</xref>).</p>
      <p>None of the subdomains of dynein's head has been solved to atomic resolution. When visualized by electron microscopy (EM), dynein's head has a ring-like appearance characteristic of oligomeric AAA+ proteins (<xref rid="bib2 bib21 bib26 bib38" ref-type="bibr">Burgess et al., 2003; Kotani et al., 2007; Mizuno et al., 2007; Samso et al., 1998</xref>). However, dynein is unusual in having its six AAA+ modules covalently linked. The AAA+ modules are thought to be arranged sequentially around the head (<xref rid="bib16 bib27 bib39" ref-type="bibr">King, 2000; Mocz and Gibbons, 2001; Serohijos et al., 2006</xref>), and support for this arrangement for AAA1–AAA4 has been obtained (<xref rid="bib42" ref-type="bibr">Takahashi et al., 2004</xref>). However, current structural data do not define the positions of AAA+ modules within the head, so their organization relative to one another and to other subdomains remains to be elucidated.</p>
      <p>C-terminal to AAA6 is a region (referred to here as the C sequence; <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>A) of unknown fold but essential for motor function (<xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr">Gee et al., 1997</xref>). Fungal dynein isoforms have shorter C sequences (of ∼15 kDa) that correspond to the first part of the longer C sequences (∼46 kDa) of other dyneins (<xref rid="bib27" ref-type="bibr">Mocz and Gibbons, 2001</xref>). EM studies suggesting seven lobes of density around the head (<xref rid="bib1 bib20" ref-type="bibr">Burgess and Knight, 2004; Koonce and Samso, 2004</xref>) have led to a model in which the AAA+ modules are arranged sequentially, with the C sequence forming a seventh domain between AAA1 and AAA6 (<xref rid="bib12 bib16 bib26 bib34 bib39" ref-type="bibr">Hook and Vallee, 2006; King, 2000; Mizuno et al., 2007; Oiwa and Sakakibara, 2005; Serohijos et al., 2006</xref>). However, this heptameric model is untested.</p>
      <p>N-terminal to AAA1 is an ∼60 kDa region (referred to here as the N sequence; <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>A) also essential for motor activity (<xref rid="bib9 bib19" ref-type="bibr">Gee et al., 1997; Koonce and Samso, 1996</xref>). ATP-dependent movement of the N terminus of the motor domain relative to the head has been suggested by fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) studies using green fluorescent protein (GFP) and blue fluorescent protein (BFP) -tagged motor domains (<xref rid="bib13 bib18 bib28" ref-type="bibr">Imamula et al., 2007; Kon et al., 2005; Mogami et al., 2007</xref>). These FRET studies define two major conformations of the motor, referred to here as primed and unprimed. Binding of ATP is associated with the priming stroke. Release of hydrolysis products triggers the powerstroke when the motor is bound to MT, or an unpriming stroke when the motor is free in solution. In vitro motility studies suggest that the N sequence has a lever-like function, acting as the main transmitter of mechanical motion during these transitions (<xref rid="bib36 bib41" ref-type="bibr">Reck-Peterson et al., 2006; Shima et al., 2006b</xref>). This is consistent with a linker swing model in which the N sequence corresponds to the linker and undergoes a powerstroke (<xref rid="bib32" ref-type="bibr">Numata et al., 2008</xref>). However, a recent EM study was interpreted as showing the motor N terminus of cytoplasmic dynein at random positions around the head, arguing that the N sequence in this species is instead a highly flexible linkage to the cargo (<xref rid="bib25" ref-type="bibr">Meng et al., 2006</xref>). Therefore, structural evidence for N sequence function is currently controversial.</p>
      <p>Here we map by negative-stain EM the positions of key sites within the cytoplasmic dynein motor domain of <italic>Dictyostelium discoideum</italic>. We use GFP-dynein fusion proteins, including those used in the earlier FRET study (<xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr">Kon et al., 2005</xref>) to map the positions of the motor N terminus in primed and unprimed conformations and identify the positions of six other sites within the unprimed head. The tags are β barrel proteins (<xref rid="bib47" ref-type="bibr">Yang et al., 1996</xref>), which we locate by EM. We also report the structure of truncation constructs in which the N and C sequences are removed. From these data, we present a model for the subdomain organization and mechanism of dynein.</p>

    <sec id="sec2">
      <title>Results</title>
      <p>The motor domain of cytoplasmic dynein in the unprimed conformation adopts two orientations on the EM grid under our negative staining conditions, giving two distinct ring-like views (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figures 1</xref>B and 1C). The most common view (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>B) is similar to previous images of an identical motor construct (<xref rid="bib37" ref-type="bibr">Samso and Koonce, 2004</xref>). We refer to this here as the “top” view because it corresponds to the view looking directly along the channel axis in their 3D reconstruction. With the image oriented so that the stalk emerges at the 11 o'clock position, well-defined stain-excluding lobes are visible around the left side of the head, while density on the other side is stronger but less distinct. The second view (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>C) resembles the “right” view of axonemal dynein-c (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>D) (<xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr">Burgess et al., 2003</xref>). The right view similarly oriented (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>C) shows pronounced stain-excluding lobes around the upper and right side of the head and less differentiated density on the left side. A spike and a groove (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>C, arrowheads) are pronounced in the cytoplasmic dynein. However, the main conclusion from these first images of right views of cytoplasmic dynein is that the head structures of axonemal and cytoplasmic isoforms are strikingly similar.</p>
      <sec id="sec2.1">
        <title>Location and Structure of the Stalk in the Unprimed Motor</title>
        <p>Image classification reveals that the MT-binding stalk emerges at a range of angles from a fixed position in the head (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>; see <xref rid="app2" ref-type="sec">Movie S3</xref> available online). In top views it emerges from a prominent lobe of density, whereas in right views it emerges between two adjacent lobes (see also <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>C). The stalk is about 2 nm wide, consistent with the prediction of a coiled-coil structure. The visible coiled coil is 10.4 nm long. With the ∼4 nm distal MTBD this is very similar to the length of dynein-c's stalk (<xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr">Burgess et al., 2003</xref>). The coiled coil of dynein-c in the unprimed conformation has a bend about two-thirds along its length (<xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr">Burgess et al., 2003</xref>), which may correspond to a proline residue within the outward α helix (<xref rid="bib46" ref-type="bibr">Yagi et al., 2005</xref>). By contrast, the stalk of cytoplasmic dynein lacks this proline and is straight, except for an occasional kink (to the right) at its distal end immediately adjacent to the MTBD (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>).</p>

      <sec id="sec2.2">
        <title>Dynein's Six AAA+ Modules Alone Form a Ring</title>
        <p>To investigate the structure of the head domain, in particular the contribution made by the AAA+ region, we engineered truncation constructs lacking the C sequence (ΔC), the N sequence (ΔN), and both these flanking sequences (ΔNΔC; see <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>A). Functional assays showed that the C sequence is not required for basal ATPase but is required for MT-binding and motile activities, whereas the N sequence is required for all these activities (<xref rid="app2" ref-type="sec">Table S1</xref>). Analytical ultracentrifugation showed that all three truncation constructs retain a low frictional coefficient similar to the intact motor domain, indicative of a compact fold (<xref rid="app2" ref-type="sec">Table S1</xref>).</p>
        <p>EM and image processing reveal that the ΔC construct, which lacks all 406 residues C-terminal to AAA6, is strikingly similar to the motor domain in the right view (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>B). The head has the same overall asymmetric ring shape and the stalk is present in the same place (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>C). The main difference is the appearance of reduced density to the right of the central stain pool and a loss of the spike on the left margin of the head (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figures 3</xref>B and 3C). The ΔC construct does not show a gap in the head corresponding to a missing peripheral domain that would be expected from heptameric models.</p>
        <p>A subset of ΔC molecules (∼8%) has a different appearance. An extended lobe of material protrudes from the head opposite the stalk (arrowhead, <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>B) and is variable in position. This structure has appropriate dimensions to be the linker previously identified in axonemal dynein-c (<xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr">Burgess et al., 2003</xref>). Such images suggest that deletion of the C sequence can destabilize linker-head interactions to favor linker undocking.</p>
        <p>ΔN molecules, which lack the 542 residues N-terminal to AAA1, show a striking new “ring” appearance, rather than top or right views (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>B). This new appearance is more symmetrical, with wedge-shaped densities defined by radial lines of stain. The stalk is intact (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>C) and emerges from one of the wedge-shaped densities.</p>
        <p>ΔNΔC molecules, which lack both N and C sequences, also show a ring appearance. The ΔNΔC ring is surprisingly similar to the ΔN ring (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>B), despite the loss of the C sequence, equivalent in length to two AAA+ modules. The main difference between ΔNΔC and ΔN is weaker density at the ∼8 o'clock position (as orientated in <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>B), and increased variability in this region, as indicated by less sharply defined density here (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>C). Overall, the ring appears complete and the stalk is intact (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>C).</p>
        <p>These truncation constructs reveal several new aspects of the organization within the dynein head. The C sequence is not an integral part of the ring as proposed in heptameric models. Instead, the C sequence may stabilize closure of the ring because its removal causes structural variability opposite the stalk. Removal of the N sequence reveals a more symmetrical ring, recalling images of other ring-shaped AAA+ proteins (<xref rid="bib27" ref-type="bibr">Mocz and Gibbons, 2001</xref>). Together, these results show that dynein's six AAA+ modules alone form a ring structure.</p>

        <title>Mapping Sites within the Motor Domain Using GFP-Based Tags</title>
        <p>To determine how the heavy-chain sequence maps onto the morphology of the motor domain, we used EM to examine fusion proteins in which GFP and BFP were inserted at seven different locations (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>A; <xref rid="app2" ref-type="sec">Figure S1</xref>).

The results from these two methods are consistent. We then applied image classification to the regions identified by the first two methods, to show the tags in more detail (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>B). The tags appear as globular densities consistent with the β barrel structures of GFP and BFP. To locate the tags accurately and without bias, we used an automatic detection procedure (see legend, <xref rid="app2" ref-type="sec">Figure S2</xref>) and calculated their mean positions (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>C), which we describe in detail below.</p>

To investigate this we located the B7 tag, inserted about one-third through the C sequence (corresponding approximately to the naturally truncated C terminus of fungal dyneins). Difference mapping shows that the B7 tag has an internal position within the head in top and right views (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>B) in contrast to the other tags. In both views, B7 is located within ∼6 nm of the base of the stalk. To map where the C sequence terminates, we imaged a new construct with BFP fused at the C terminus of the motor (BC). The BC tag lies on the head periphery between the B5 and B6 tags (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>B).

        <title>Movement of the Linker during the Priming Stroke</title>
        <p>To investigate dynein's motile mechanism, we located the position of the GFP tag attached to the linker N terminus in the unprimed and primed conformations. To generate the primed conformation, we treated the motor with ATP and vanadate to trap the ADP.Vi complex (<xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr">Kon et al., 2005</xref>). Most strikingly, in ADP.Vi motors, GFP is shifted toward AAA2 (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref>A). This is seen in both right view (4% of motors) and top view (96%), although the distribution of GFP positions differs in these two views. In right view, all ADP.Vi motors show GFP close to AAA2 (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref>B). In top view, the distribution is bimodal: 44% show GFP near AAA2, while 56% show GFP near the stalk base, coinciding with its unprimed location (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref>B). This leads us to speculate that in the ADP.Vi motor (1) the linker exists in a poised equilibrium between primed and unprimed conformations and (2) the equilibrium position is altered by the orientation of the molecule on the EM grid. This might be analogous to the situation in other motors, where crystallization conditions are thought to shift conformational equilibria of myosin's converter domain and kinesin's neck linker (<xref rid="bib44" ref-type="bibr">Vale and Milligan, 2000</xref>). Our 3D analysis (below) shows that in the top view, but not the right view, the linker swing has a large component in the z direction, suggesting that the top view is the more likely of the two to have been influenced by the EM grid. The distal portion of dynein's linker is occasionally revealed in top views of ADP.Vi motors, as a rod ∼2 nm thick (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref>A, arrows) connecting the N-terminal GFP to the head (close to the B2 site). Together, these observations suggest that during the priming stroke, the motor N terminus moves from near the stalk base and AAA4 toward AAA2 by a swing of the linker.</p>
        <p>The mean displacement of GFP during the priming stroke is 19 nm in right views (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6</xref>B). Measurement in top views is complicated by the broader distribution of GFP in ADP.Vi motors. Based on Gaussian fits to the bimodal distribution of GFP angles around the head (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref>B), we segregated the ADP.Vi motors into two subpopulations (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref>, legend). We define the motors in the subpopulation nearer AAA2 as the primed conformation. Using the mean GFP position of this subpopulation, the displacement of GFP during the priming stroke is 13 nm in top views (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6</xref>B). In both views, the direction of the linker swing is almost parallel to the long axis of the stalk.</p>
        <p>Right views of ADP.Vi motors show a prominent accumulation of stain at the base of the stalk (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref>C, arrow), not seen in apo/ADP motors. This change at the stalk base likely occurs because of movement of the linker N terminus. This accumulation of stain suggests that the stalk coiled coil bifurcates at the junction with the head (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref>C, arrow), as reported for dynein-c (<xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr">Burgess et al., 2003</xref>).</p>

        <title>Three-Dimensional Movement of the Linker N Terminus during the Priming Stroke</title>
        <p>To determine the positions of the various tags in 3D, and the 3D movement of the linker N terminus, we calculated the angular relationship between top and right views (<xref rid="app2" ref-type="sec">Figures S3 and S4</xref>). Superficially, top and right views look like reflections of one another in a vertical mirror, suggesting they may be related by a rotation of ∼180°, but the similar emergence points of the stalk and the positions of the tags, most notably B2 and B5, rule this out (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>C). To obtain the axis of rotation between top and right views, we used the positions of tags in the unprimed motor (<xref rid="app2" ref-type="sec">Figure S3</xref>). The axis of rotation obtained (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6</xref>A) is also compatible with the segregation in top views of primed and unprimed linker conformations as defined above (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6</xref>B). We then used geometric constraints to establish that top and right views are related by a rotation of between 50° and 116° about this axis (see <xref rid="app2" ref-type="sec">Figure S4</xref>). This is consistent with our earlier interpretations of left, side, and right views of dynein-c (<xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">Burgess et al., 2004b</xref>; see <xref rid="app2" ref-type="sec">Figure S5</xref>).

This analysis shows that during the priming stroke the majority of GFP movement occurs in the plane of the right view, with a large component perpendicular to the plane of the top view (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6</xref>D). The 3D displacement of GFP is ∼19–21 nm (<xref rid="app2" ref-type="sec">Movie S4</xref>). Accounting for the size of GFP, we infer that the distance moved by the linker N terminus is ∼16–18 nm.</p>

        <title>A Model for the Dynein Motor</title>
        <p>Our protein engineering and EM data suggest a new model for cytoplasmic dynein (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7</xref>A). In this model the core of the motor is a hexameric AAA+ ring, with the N sequence and C sequence forming subdomains that interact with the ring. Our new model is a revision of heptameric models in which the C sequence closes the ring. It indicates that the route of energy transduction derived from an atomic heptameric model of dynein (<xref rid="bib39" ref-type="bibr">Serohijos et al., 2006</xref>) is without empirical foundation. The similarity we find between <italic>D. discoideum</italic> cytoplasmic dynein and <italic>Chlamydomonas reinhardtii</italic> axonemal dynein-c (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figures 1</xref>C and 1D) and dynein-f (<xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr">Kotani et al., 2007</xref>) argues that, despite over 800 million years of separate evolution (<xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">Cavalier-Smith, 2006</xref>), the overall arrangement of subdomains within the dynein motor has been conserved. Therefore, this is a model for all dynein isoforms. The hexameric AAA+ ring of dynein suggests that its mechanism may have parallels with other hexameric AAA+ mechanoenzymes. However, unlike these other AAA+ proteins, activity within dynein's AAA+ ring requires three other components: the stalk, the C sequence, and the N sequence.</p>

        <title>Allosteric Communication between Sites of ATP Hydrolysis and MT Binding</title>
        <p>We have shown that AAA1, the main ATPase site linked to force generation (<xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr">Kon et al., 2004</xref>) and control of MT binding (<xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr">Imamula et al., 2007</xref>), is located in the ring opposite the stalk (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7</xref>A). This establishes that, compared to myosin and kinesin, dynein's motor has an exceptionally long-range communication pathway. Two-way coupling between the hydrolysis cycle in AAA1 and changes in MT-binding affinity at the tip of the stalk requires transmission both across the ring and along the stalk, a distance of ∼25 nm. In axonemal dynein-c, a nucleotide-dependent structural change within the stalk was reported, involving an increase in curvature and a decrease in stiffness in ADP.Vi (<xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr">Burgess et al., 2003</xref>). Interestingly, the changes in stalk structure seen in cytoplasmic dynein are different. Here we find that the stalk tilts relative to the head between weak and strong binding states. Stalk tilting could occur as a rigid-body motion, that is, without any change in the relative positions of the two α helices of the coiled coil. Alternatively, the two α helices could undergo shear during tilting. Consistent with the latter possibility, evidence suggests that changes in registry between the α helices alter the MT-binding affinity of the stalk (<xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr">Gibbons et al., 2005</xref>). In stalks with different amino acid sequences, such as those of axonemal dynein-c and cytoplasmic dynein, this same mechanism could underlie the different structural changes observed.</p>

        <title>Location and Role of the C Sequence</title>
        <p>Our data show that the C sequence is not an integral part of dynein's ring structure. Consistent with this, the C sequence is not an absolutely conserved component of the motor. Fungal isoforms naturally lacking the C-terminal two-thirds of the C sequence still exhibit processive MT stepping (<xref rid="bib36" ref-type="bibr">Reck-Peterson et al., 2006</xref>), suggesting that the missing segment is not essential for motility. The conserved N-terminal one-third of the C sequence spans a region of the ring from AAA6 toward the stalk base. This implies that in all dyneins, the C sequence may overlap and interact with AAA6, AAA5, and possibly also AAA4 (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7</xref>A). The C sequence in <italic>Dictyostelium</italic> (<xref rid="app2" ref-type="sec">Table S1</xref>) and in rat cytoplasmic dynein (<xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr">Gee et al., 1997</xref>) is required for dynein's ability to bind MTs cyclically. By extending to near the stalk base, the C sequence may be positioned to exert allosteric control through the stalk or through the AAA+ ring.</p>

        <title>Structure and Role of the Linker</title>
        <p>The N sequence of the motor includes the linker: a lever-like structure first described in an axonemal dynein (<xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr">Burgess et al., 2003</xref>). In the unprimed conformation the linker runs across the head from AAA1, terminating near the stalk base, AAA4, and AAA5. During the priming stroke the linker swings to a position close to AAA2 (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7</xref>A). These findings explain previous biochemical and biophysical data. First, loss of motor function following truncation within the N sequence (<xref rid="bib9 bib36" ref-type="bibr">Gee et al., 1997; Reck-Peterson et al., 2006</xref>) is consistent with a disruption of interactions between the linker and the head. Even small N-terminal truncations into the linker sequence disrupt motor activity (ΔN′ construct, <xref rid="app2" ref-type="sec">Table S1</xref>; <xref rid="bib36" ref-type="bibr">Reck-Peterson et al., 2006</xref>). This distinguishes dynein's mechanical lever from that of myosin, which can be truncated without impairing ATPase (<xref rid="bib22" ref-type="bibr">Kurzawa et al., 1997</xref>). Second, in vitro motility data showing progressively reduced translocation velocities in constructs tethered to the substrate at various points within the N sequence (<xref rid="bib41" ref-type="bibr">Shima et al., 2006b</xref>) can now be interpreted in terms of its elongated structure. Third, the proximities between the N-terminal GFP tag and BFP tags within the head (<xref rid="app2" ref-type="sec">Table S2</xref>) show good agreement with estimates based on FRET efficiencies from the same constructs (<xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr">Kon et al., 2005</xref>). Our structural data demonstrate that the nucleotide-dependent FRET changes correspond to an ∼17 nm swing of the motor N terminus and that this occurs predominantly in a plane parallel to the right-view plane.</p>
        <p>In our model, priming and unpriming strokes swing the linker between AAA4 and AAA2, and across AAA3 (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7</xref>A). Our ADP.Vi data suggest that in ADP.Pi-dynein, the linker may be in equilibrium between primed and unprimed positions (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref>A) and therefore sensitive to external force. It is noteworthy that AAA2, AAA3, and AAA4 each bind nucleotide in a manner that regulates dynein function (<xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr">Kon et al., 2004</xref>). Taken together, these findings suggest the possibility that external load, linker position, and regulatory nucleotide binding may be coupled.</p>

        <title>Dynein's Priming Stroke and Implications for Stepping</title>
        <p>How might this new structural information help us understand how dynein steps along MTs? The attachment geometry of two-headed cytoplasmic dynein bound to MTs is not yet known. However, the attachment geometry of single-headed cytoplasmic dynein in the strongly bound (i.e., postpowerstroke) state has been observed (<xref rid="bib26" ref-type="bibr">Mizuno et al., 2007</xref>). In vitro motility studies have shown that two-headed dynein molecules step along MTs with center-of-mass displacements predominantly of 8 nm (the spacing between tubulin dimers) interspersed with larger steps up to 32 nm, as well as backward steps and off-axis steps (<xref rid="bib10 bib36" ref-type="bibr">Gennerich et al., 2007; Reck-Peterson et al., 2006</xref>). This distinguishes dynein from the other MT motor kinesin, which takes steps of 8 nm with high regularity. During dynein stepping, center-of-mass displacements report the movement of the fused N termini of artificially dimerized motor domains, which are therefore expected to correspond quite closely to movement of the linker N terminus. Our new structural data showing movement of the linker N terminus in 3D suggest an MT-docking geometry for our dynein model (see <xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7</xref>B and legend for further details). According to this model the right view lies in the plane that includes the MT axis, and the swing of the linker N terminus and the tilting of the stalk occur almost entirely in this plane.</p>
        <p>Our MT-bound model can account for dynein's distinguishing ability to take larger steps (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7</xref>B). If the N terminus of the linker is held in place during the priming stroke, rotation of the head and stalk against the linker can displace the MTBD by 24 nm along the MT (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7</xref>Bii). Compliance in the motor, for example in the stalk or between stalk and head (<xref rid="app2" ref-type="sec">Movie S3</xref>), could allow even greater reach along the MT and also off-axis, around the MT. On the other hand, a submaximal priming stroke would restrict the search range along the MT, leading to smaller steps (e.g., 8 nm), typical of the dimer (<xref rid="bib43 bib36" ref-type="bibr">Toba et al., 2006; Reck-Peterson et al., 2006</xref>). Our finding that movement of the linker N terminus occurs roughly parallel to the long axis of the stalk suggests that the priming stroke causes the MTBD to skate along the MT surface (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7</xref>Bii). <xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">Gennerich et al. (2007)</xref> have proposed that the affinity of the MTBD for MT is sensitive to the angle between the stalk and the MT. We favor this model, because the low stalk-MT angle demanded for larger steps (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7</xref>Bii) would disfavor MT reattachment, thereby biasing the motor toward smaller steps. During the subsequent powerstroke a swing of the linker toward AAA4 pulls cytoplasmic dynein forward (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7</xref>Biii). In this model, dynein acts like a winch (<xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr">Burgess and Knight, 2004</xref>) with the linker acting as the crank. This model is compatible with previous functional studies (<xref rid="bib10 bib13 bib28 bib36 bib41" ref-type="bibr">Gennerich et al., 2007; Imamula et al., 2007; Mogami et al., 2007; Reck-Peterson et al., 2006; Shima et al., 2006b</xref>), but further such studies are necessary to test specific features of it.</p>
        <p>In flagellar outer-arm dyneins containing either two or three heads, the rings appear stacked upon one another in situ (<xref rid="bib14 bib24 bib30 bib33" ref-type="bibr">Ishikawa et al., 2007; Lupetti et al., 2005; Nicastro et al., 2006; Oda et al., 2007</xref>), implying that in these systems the two or three linkers could have different environments, with some sandwiched between two adjacent rings. This poses the intriguing possibility that during their priming and power strokes the linker swing might be restrained or regulated. Whether ring-ring stacking occurs in cytoplasmic dyneins remains unknown. Higher-resolution 3D structures of the motor domain and of two-headed dynein bound to MTs will be necessary to answer some of these outstanding questions. The subdomain mapping and conformational changes reported here will aid interpretation of such new data.</p>

Analytical ultracentrifugation was performed as described (<xref rid="bib48" ref-type="bibr">Zhao et al., 2003</xref>), and frictional coefficients were determined using f ∝ M/S for each species (f, frictional coefficient; M, molecular weight; S, sedimentation coefficient).</p>

        <title>Sample Preparation and Electron Microscopy</title>
        <p>Dynein constructs were prepared for negative-stain EM as described (<xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">Burgess et al., 2004a</xref>). Constructs were diluted to ∼40 nM with either buffer 1 (20 mM K-MOPS, 20 mM KCl, 5 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 1 mM EGTA [pH 7.4]), buffer 2 (10 mM K-PIPES, 50 mM K-acetate, 4 mM MgSO<sub>4</sub>, 1 mM EGTA [pH 7.0]), or buffer 3 (30 mM K-MOPS, 15 mM KCl, 2 mM MgSO<sub>4</sub>, 0.2 mM EGTA, 16% v/v methanol [pH 7.4]). No differences in dynein structure were observed between these different buffer conditions.</p>
        <p>Samples were negatively stained with 1% uranyl acetate on carbon-coated grids that had been freshly UV treated. For the unprimed conformation, samples were either pretreated with apyrase (10 U/ml for 30 min or 24 hr on ice) to remove ADP and ATP, or used directly after dilution (all ATP in the PMEG buffer had been hydrolyzed to ADP, as confirmed by HPLC [data not shown], giving a final ADP concentration of 4–666 μM). To trap constructs in the primed conformation, samples were treated with 200 μM ATP and 200 μM sodium orthovanadate (residual ADP concentration was 4 μM). FRET assays with GN-motor-BFP constructs were used to confirm that these treatments generated the primed and unprimed conformations, as described (<xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr">Kon et al., 2005</xref>).</p>
        <p>Micrographs were taken at 40,000× nominal magnification and calibrated using the paramyosin spacing of 14.4 nm (<xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">Elliott et al., 1976</xref>) on a JEOL 1200 EX operating at 80 kV with an LaB<sub>6</sub> electron source. Micrographs were digitized on an Imacon Flextight 848 scanner (Hasselblad A/S, Copenhagen, Denmark), giving a final object sampling of 0.504 nm/pixel.</p>

      <sec id="sec4.4">
        <title>Image Processing</title>
        <p>Digitized images were imported into either SPIDER (<xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">Frank, 2006</xref>) or BOXER (<xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr">Ludtke et al., 1999</xref>) for manual or automatic identification of particles, respectively. Particles were cut out from micrographs and aligned in SPIDER using reference-free methods and classified using IMAGIC (Image Science Software GmbH, Berlin, Germany) or SPIDER as described (<xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">Burgess et al., 2004a</xref>). Details of image classification can be found in figure legends in <xref rid="app2" ref-type="sec">Supplemental Data</xref>. Classes showing well-stained top, right, or ring views were selected manually and processed separately in subsequent steps. The number of particles analyzed is as follows: 11,504 (control motor); 10,863 (GN-motor); 12,987 (GN-motor-B1); 34,625 (GN-motor-B2); 34,875 (motor-B5); 10,810 (GN-motor-B6); 19,284 (GN-motor-B7); 7,628 (GN-motor-BC); 13,027 (ΔC); 4,407 (ΔN); 9,648 (ΔNΔC); 26,298 (GN-motor-B1 primed); and 19,750 (GN-motor-B1 unprimed); 215,706 (total).</p>

        <title>Orientation of Top and Right Views</title>
        <p>The axis of rotation relating top and right views was obtained by sinogram analysis (<xref rid="bib45" ref-type="bibr">van Heel et al., 2000</xref>) in IMAGIC using the mean positions of GFP and BFP (GN, B1, B2, and B5) and the maxima of the difference maps for B7 in the unprimed motor (for details, see <xref rid="app2" ref-type="sec">Figure S3</xref>). The magnitude of rotation about this axis was estimated by constraining simultaneously the radius of all tags to lie within 12.0 nm of the rotation axis (for details, see <xref rid="app2" ref-type="sec">Figure S4</xref>).</p>

          </caption>
          <p>Features within a different region around the perimeter of the head were analyzed by using masks with a radial extent of ∼15 nm and excluding features within the head, thus “scanning” the perimeter of the head in search of GFP-based tag positions. The position and shape of the mask are evident from the noise fluctuations visible in the movie. Most positions show only noise, but occasionally globular densities appear corresponding to the inserted GFP and BFP moieties. This “scanning” classification confirms the positions of tags (colored arrowheads) obtained by difference mapping (Figure S2). See full legend in Supplemental Data for further details.</p>

      <p>Since acceptance of this manuscript, a paper has been published describing the crystal structure of the MTBD and distal coiled coil of a cytoplasmic dynein (Carter, A.P., Garbarino, J.E., Wilson-Kubalek, E.M., Shipley, W.E., Cho, C., Milligan, R.A., Vale, R.D., and Gibbons, I.R.

        <p>(A) Heavy-chain sequence diagram showing six AAA+ modules (numbered), N and C sequences, and the MT-binding domain (MTBD). On the right, the cartoon shows the stalk-head-tail architecture of dynein (tail formerly known as the stem).</p>
        <p>(B and C) Negative-stain EM and single-particle image processing of the motor domain reveals two characteristic appearances: top and right views.</p>

        <p>(A) Motor domain sequence (residues 1383–4725) showing sites of insertion of GFP and BFP in the constructs examined (GN, inserted upstream of V1383; B1, after A2172; B2, after S2471; B5, after K3928; B6, after E4261; B7, after S4450; BC, after I4725).</p>
        <p>(B) Class averages of top and right views showing each tag (arrowheads) near its mean position. The internal position of the B7 tag is shown by difference mapping (see <xref rid="app2" ref-type="sec">Figure S2</xref> for details) which, because of superposition with the head, means that the BFP could not be shown by image classification. Difference maps are contoured at 5σ above the mean then at intervals of 2σ, superposed on global averages faded for clarity. No right views were obtained for B6- and BC-tagged constructs.</p>

        <p>Structural Changes between Unprimed and Primed Conformations</p>
        <p>(A) Motor tagged with GFP at the N terminus and BFP at the B1 site in apo/ADP and ADP.Vi states. Small panels: representative class averages showing N-terminal GFP and distal linker (arrows). Larger panels: GFP positions detected automatically (white spots). In ADP.Vi-motors in top view, GFP positions are segregated into primed and unprimed positions (dashed line; see B).</p>
        <p>(B) Histograms showing angular position of N-terminal GFP measured clockwise relative to an axis passing through the head center and the base of the stalk (cartoon). Mean GFP angle in right view is 10° ± 11° (n = 375) in apo/ADP compared to 145° ± 11° (mean ± SD, n = 557 molecules) in ADP.Vi. Gaussian fits to the top-view data in ADP.Vi give two peaks for GFP angles of 41° ± 18° (mean ± SD) and 124° ± 25°, which intersect at 80° (dashed line). The low-angle peak coincides with that of unprimed motors (also 41° ± 18°). The numbers of molecules in top views are 9,964 (apo/ADP) and 13,527 (ADP.Vi).</p>
        <p>(C) Average stalk angles show a clockwise tilt between unprimed and primed motors (gray and magenta arrowheads, respectively). Stalk angles: right view: unprimed −16° ± 9° (mean ± SD, n = 3858 molecules), primed 0° ± 8° (n = 526); top view: unprimed −6° ± 6° (n = 1604), primed −4° ± 6° (n = 1667). White spots show positions of distal coiled coil in each of the ten classes used to obtain these values (see also <xref rid="app2" ref-type="sec">Movie S3</xref>). Bifurcation of the stalk is indicated (arrow). Right-view unprimed motor is tagged with BFP at the B2 site rather than at the B1 site. The scale bars represent 5 nm.</p>

        <p>Magnitude and Direction of the Linker Swing</p>
        <p>In this figure, right and top views of the dynein head are related by a rotation about the y axis (see <xref rid="app2" ref-type="sec">Figure S3</xref> for details): each view has been rotated in the plane of the page relative to previous figures so that tag positions move only in the x direction (dashed lines).</p>
        <p>(A) Tag positions in the unprimed motor are indicated by colored spots (as in <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>C).</p>
        <p>(B) For the primed motor, the mean position of the N-terminal GFP tag (brighter magenta spots; derived for top view as explained in the main text) also moves only in the x direction. Magnitudes of the displacements from the unprimed positions (faded magenta spots) are indicated (arrows).</p>
        <p>(C and D) Top and right views are related by a rotation of between 50° and 116° (see <xref rid="app2" ref-type="sec">Figure S4</xref> for details): illustrated here is a rotation of 90° (see also <xref rid="app2" ref-type="sec">Movie S4</xref>). Tag positions in the unprimed conformation (C) and N-terminal GFP in the unprimed and primed conformations (D). In each case, the bottom surface of the cube shows their projected positions perpendicular to top and right views. The black arrow shows movement of N-terminal GFP during the priming stroke, which has a major component perpendicular to the plane of the top view and parallel to the plane of the right view. The 3D displacement of N-terminal GFP lies between 18.8 and 21.1 nm (depending on the rotation angle between right and top views).</p>

        <p>Model for the Structure and Priming Stroke of Dynein</p>
        <p>(A) Six AAA+ modules (numbered) form a hexameric ring. The C sequence (translucent black) is represented speculatively as an elongated structure interacting with (one or another face of) AAA6, AAA5, and AAA4. The N sequence (magenta) contains the linker which runs from AAA1 across the head to AAA4 (yellow) in the unprimed conformation and switches to a position close to AAA2 in the primed conformation, thereby moving the N terminus of the motor by ∼17 nm (in right view in a plane parallel to the page). The N sequence may also contain nonlinker structures, such as near the junction with AAA1 (magenta ellipse). Tilting of the stalk, shown here to occur entirely in the plane of the page in right view (see <xref rid="app2" ref-type="sec">Figure S3</xref>), displaces the MTBD by ∼5 nm and could shift the registration of the two α helices of the coiled coil (indicated by red and blue spots). Stalk tilting perpendicular to the page is not seen in top-view data (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref>C), probably because the stalk flattens down onto the EM grid in this orientation.</p>
        <p>(B) Model to illustrate how the linker swing and stalk tilt could produce one of dynein's larger displacements along an MT (see <xref rid="sec3" ref-type="sec">Discussion</xref> for further details). The attachment geometry proposed here (i and iii) is compatible with <xref rid="bib26" ref-type="bibr">Mizuno et al. (2007)</xref> and uses the right view, which ensures that movement of the linker N terminus occurs in a plane parallel to the MT axis. With the linker N terminus initially restrained (red asterisk), perhaps by attachment to the second head as observed in dimeric dynein-f (<xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr">Kotani et al., 2007</xref>), ATP binding (ii) causes MT detachment and the priming stroke which displaces the MTBD along the MT, here by 24 nm. Subsequent reattachment and powerstroke (iii) displaces the linker N terminus by 24 nm (green asterisk). α-β tubulin dimers are shown (to scale) as pairs of dark and light gray spheres with red and green dimers showing initial and final binding sites, respectively.</p>
