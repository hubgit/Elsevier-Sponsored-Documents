        <title>Summary</title>
        <p>The burden of type 2 diabetes and its associated premature morbidity and mortality is rapidly growing, and the need for novel efficacious treatments is pressing. We report here that serotonin 2C receptor (5-HT<sub>2C</sub>R) agonists, typically investigated for their anorectic properties, significantly improve glucose tolerance and reduce plasma insulin in murine models of obesity and type 2 diabetes. Importantly, 5-HT<sub>2C</sub>R agonist-induced improvements in glucose homeostasis occurred at concentrations of agonist that had no effect on ingestive behavior, energy expenditure, locomotor activity, body weight, or fat mass. We determined that this primary effect on glucose homeostasis requires downstream activation of melanocortin-4 receptors (MC4Rs), but not MC3Rs. These findings suggest that pharmacological targeting of 5-HT<sub>2C</sub>Rs may enhance glucose tolerance independently of alterations in body weight and that this may prove an effective and mechanistically novel strategy in the treatment of type 2 diabetes.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>The prevalence of type 2 diabetes has surged in recent decades. A growing body of work suggests not only that central neural pathways may play an important role in dysregulation of glucose homeostasis but also that these pathways are potentially amenable to therapeutic manipulation. Pharmacological compounds augmenting the tone of the neurotransmitter serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine, 5-HT) have been extensively investigated for the treatment of obesity (<xref rid="bib4 bib17" ref-type="bibr">Dourish, 1995; Simansky, 1996</xref>), a major risk factor for type 2 diabetes. However, the possibility of a direct role for serotonin in the pathophysiology and treatment of type 2 diabetes has received little attention.</p>
      <p>Serotonin's effects on physiology and behavior are mediated by multiple serotonin receptors (5-HTRs) clustered into seven distinct families that are widely expressed in the central and/or peripheral nervous systems (<xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr">Barnes and Sharp, 1999</xref>). Murine knockout studies reveal that only deletion of the gene encoding the 5-HT<sub>2C</sub> receptor (5-HT<sub>2C</sub>R, formerly denoted 5-HT<sub>1C</sub>R) produces insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes, with antecedent hyperphagia and obesity (<xref rid="bib2 bib14 bib19" ref-type="bibr">Bonasera and Tecott, 2000; Nonogaki et al., 1998; Tecott et al., 1995</xref>). These genetic studies demonstrate that 5-HT<sub>2C</sub>Rs are critical for energy homeostasis but do not indicate whether serotonin generally or 5-HT<sub>2C</sub>Rs specifically have a primary effect on glucose homeostasis that is dissociable from effects on body weight. Here, we examined whether 5-HT<sub>2C</sub>R agonists are effective in improving glucose tolerance in murine models of obesity and insulin resistance and whether these effects can be achieved in the absence of reductions in food intake and body weight.</p>

        <title>5-HT<sub>2C</sub>R Agonists Improve Glucose Homeostasis</title>
        <p>To investigate whether 5-HT<sub>2C</sub>R stimulation affects glucose homeostasis, hyperinsulinemic diet-induced obese (DIO) male mice were treated with saline or a subanorectic dose of the classic 5-HT<sub>2C</sub>R agonist <italic>m</italic>-chlorophenylpiperazine (mCPP; 1 mg/kg/day) via subcutaneous (s.c.) osmotic minipump for 14 days. Baseline fasting plasma insulin and blood glucose were determined 2 days preceding pump implantation (day −2) and after 14 days of saline or mCPP infusion. While saline treatment did not significantly affect any parameter assessed, mCPP treatment produced a 49% reduction in fasting plasma insulin (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>A; t(4) = 4.3, p &lt; 0.01) without altering blood glucose (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>B), food intake (high-fat diet [HFD]; <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>C), or body weight (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>D).</p>
        <p>We further characterized this effect using the <italic>Lep<sup>ob</sup></italic> (<italic>ob/ob</italic>) murine model of severe obesity and insulin resistance, a second 5-HT<sub>2C</sub>R agonist, and another diet. Mice were individually housed in Comprehensive Lab Animal Monitoring System (CLAMS) chambers recording food intake, locomotor activity, and energy expenditure. Baseline and treatment-induced changes in fasting plasma insulin, fasting blood glucose, and % body fat were also measured. Hyperinsulinemic male <italic>ob/ob</italic> mice receiving a subanorectic dose of the selective 5-HT<sub>2C</sub>R agonist BVT.X (40 mg/kg/day) for 14 days exhibited a 45% improvement in fasting plasma insulin (see <xref rid="app2" ref-type="sec">Figure S1</xref>A in the <xref rid="app2" ref-type="sec">Supplemental Data</xref> available with this article online; t(6) = 3.8, p &lt; 0.01) with no concomitant change in blood glucose (<xref rid="app2" ref-type="sec">Figure S1</xref>B), food intake (powdered chow; <xref rid="app2" ref-type="sec">Figure S1</xref>C), body weight (<xref rid="app2" ref-type="sec">Figure S1</xref>D), % body fat (<xref rid="app2" ref-type="sec">Figure S1</xref>E), locomotor activity (<xref rid="app2" ref-type="sec">Figure S1</xref>F), or energy expenditure (VO<sub>2</sub>; <xref rid="app2" ref-type="sec">Figure S1</xref>G). These data indicate that 5-HT<sub>2C</sub>R agonists ameliorate hyperinsulinemia in mild and severe obesity independently of alterations in food intake and body weight.</p>
        <p>To establish whether 5-HT<sub>2C</sub>R activation enhances glucose tolerance, hyperinsulinemic drug-naive DIO mice were given a single injection of mCPP 45 min prior to a glucose tolerance test (GTT; 1 g/kg glucose, administered intraperitoneally [i.p.]). mCPP produced significant improvements in glucose tolerance (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>E; F(3,9) = 488.2, p &lt; 0.001). Pretreatment with the selective 5-HT<sub>2C</sub>R antagonist RS102221 (RS; 1 mg/kg, i.p.; <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>E) abolished this effect, confirming that mCPP-induced improvements in glucose tolerance are 5-HT<sub>2C</sub>R mediated.</p>

        <title>5-HT<sub>2C</sub>R Agonists Upregulate POMC mRNA</title>
        <p>5-HT<sub>2C</sub>Rs are expressed in multiple regions of the central nervous system (<xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr">Molineaux et al., 1989</xref>). Of particular interest are a population of 5-HT<sub>2C</sub>Rs coexpressed with neurons producing the endogenous melanocortin receptor agonist α-melanocyte-stimulating hormone (α-MSH) in the arcuate nucleus of the hypothalamus (ARC) (<xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr">Heisler et al., 2002</xref>). Pharmacological activation of central melanocortin pathways enhances insulin sensitivity, and overexpression of the precursor to α-MSH, pro-opiomelanocortin (POMC), attenuates insulin resistance in <italic>ob/ob</italic> mice (<xref rid="bib8 bib12 bib15" ref-type="bibr">Heijboer et al., 2005; Mizuno et al., 2003; Obici et al., 2001</xref>). This led us to hypothesize that 5-HT<sub>2C</sub>R agonist-induced improvements in insulin sensitivity involve stimulation of POMC synthesis in the ARC. To address this possibility, <italic>ob/ob</italic> mice were treated with saline or BVT.X (40 mg/kg/day) via s.c. osmotic minipump for 7 days prior to densitometric quantification of ARC POMC mRNA with in situ hybridization histochemistry (ISHH). BVT.X produced a significant increase in the density of POMC mRNA in the ARC (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>F, left; t(4) = 2.8, p &lt; 0.05) in association with a significant reduction in fasting plasma insulin (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>F, right; t(4) = 3.5, p &lt; 0.05). These data suggest that 5-HT<sub>2C</sub>R agonist-induced improvements in hyperinsulinemia may be achieved through increased α-MSH availability.</p>

        <title>The Effect of 5-HT<sub>2C</sub>R Agonists on Glycemia Requires Central Melanocortin Receptors</title>
        <p>To confirm that the effect of 5-HT<sub>2C</sub>R agonists on glucose tolerance is mediated by central melanocortin pathways, we investigated whether pharmacological blockade of central melanocortin-3 receptors (MC3Rs) and melanocortin-4 receptors (MC4Rs) hinders the ability of mCPP to enhance glucose tolerance. Specifically, hyperinsulinemic DIO mice were pretreated with the MC3R/MC4R antagonist SHU9119 (0.1 nmol, administered intracerebroventricularly [i.c.v.]) and then treated with mCPP (1 mg/kg, i.p.) prior to receiving a glucose bolus (1 g/kg glucose, i.p.). Once again, a significant improvement in glucose tolerance was seen after treatment with mCPP (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>G; F(3,25) = 5.1, p &lt; 0.01), an effect that was completely abrogated by pretreatment with SHU9119. The melanocortin antagonist in isolation had no discernible effect on glycemic excursion.</p>
        <p>To assess insulin sensitivity more directly, we next performed an insulin tolerance test (ITT; 0.5 U insulin/kg, i.p.) in DIO mice and found that mCPP significantly enhanced the hypoglycemic response to insulin (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>H; F(3,30) = 3.5, p &lt; 0.05). This effect was fully reversed by i.c.v. pretreatment with SHU9119 (0.1 nmol, i.c.v.), which alone had no significant effect on insulin tolerance. Importantly, mice undergoing GTTs or ITTs did not have access to food, and the concentration of mCPP used did not affect appetite when tested in obese mice (<xref rid="app2" ref-type="sec">Figure S2</xref>A). These findings confirm that 5-HT<sub>2C</sub>R agonist-induced improvements in glucose and insulin tolerance are dependent on central melanocortin pathways and are dissociable from effects on food intake.</p>

        <title>The Effect of 5-HT<sub>2C</sub>R Agonists Is Mediated Specifically via MC4Rs</title>
        <p>Efforts to discriminate the role of specific melanocortin receptors indicate that neural outputs important for maintaining insulin sensitivity are coupled to melanocortin tone primarily through MC4Rs (<xref rid="bib6 bib8 bib10 bib7" ref-type="bibr">Fan et al., 2000; Heijboer et al., 2005; Huszar et al., 1997; Farooqi et al., 2000</xref>). We thus hypothesized that the mechanism underlying 5-HT<sub>2C</sub>R agonist-induced insulin sensitization involves increased activation of MC4Rs via upregulation of ARC POMC mRNA synthesis. We examined this hypothesis using obese and hyperinsulinemic <italic>Mc4r</italic> KO mice (<xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">Huszar et al., 1997</xref>) and <italic>Mc3r</italic> KO littermates (<xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">Butler et al., 2000</xref>) maintained on HFD to induce comparable obesity and hyperinsulinemia. Mice were treated via s.c. osmotic minipump with saline or mCPP (1 mg/kg/day) for 14 days. mCPP substantially reduced hyperinsulinemia (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>A; t(4) = 4.3, p &lt; 0.01) without affecting blood glucose (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>B) and improved glucose tolerance (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>C; F(1,7) = 387.2, p &lt; 0.001) in <italic>Mc3r</italic> KO mice to the same extent observed in wild-type (WT) DIO mice (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figures 1</xref>A, 1B, 1E, and 1G), effects achieved without altering food intake (<xref rid="app2" ref-type="sec">Figure S2</xref>B) or body weight (<xref rid="app2" ref-type="sec">Figure S2</xref>C). Improvements in glucose tolerance (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>D; F(1,7) = 387.2, p &lt; 0.001) and insulin tolerance (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>E; F(1,7) = 4.05, p &lt; 0.05) were also observed in drug-naive <italic>Mc3r</italic> KO mice treated with a single injection of mCPP 45 min prior to a glucose (1 g/kg, i.p.) or insulin (0.5 U/kg, i.p.) load. In marked contrast, mCPP produced no discernable effect in <italic>Mc4r</italic> KO animals (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figures 2</xref>F–2J; <xref rid="app2" ref-type="sec">Figures S2</xref>A, S2D, and S2E), supporting a specific role for the MC4R in mCPP-induced improvements in glucose tolerance.</p>

        <p>MC4Rs are expressed in brain regions containing both sympathetic and parasympathetic preganglionic neurons, each of which has been suggested to modulate glucose homeostasis (<xref rid="bib11 bib16" ref-type="bibr">Kishi et al., 2003; Pocai et al., 2005</xref>). We investigated candidate populations of MC4Rs contributing to 5-HT<sub>2C</sub>R agonist-induced improvements in glucose tolerance using Fos-like immunoreactivity (FOS-IR) as a marker of neuronal activation in <italic>Mc4r</italic> KO mice and WT littermates treated with saline or mCPP (1 mg/kg, i.p.) prior to a glucose load (1 g/kg, i.p). Compared to saline treatment, mCPP induced a significant increase in FOS-IR in POMC neurons in the ARC of both <italic>Mc4r</italic> KO and WT mice (<xref rid="app2" ref-type="sec">Figure S3</xref>; t(16) = 5.9, p &lt; 0.001). POMC neurons have direct projections to the intermediolateral nucleus of the spinal cord (IML), which contains sympathetic preganglionic neurons expressing MC4Rs (<xref rid="bib5 bib11" ref-type="bibr">Elias et al., 1998; Kishi et al., 2003</xref>). Consistent with enhanced sympathetic activity, we observed a significant increase in FOS-IR expression bilaterally in IML neurons of WT mice treated with mCPP compared to saline (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figures 3</xref>A–3D; <xref rid="app2" ref-type="sec">Figure S4</xref>; t(16) = 4.2, p &lt; 0.001), an effect absent in <italic>Mc4r</italic> KO mice (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figures 3</xref>E–3F; <xref rid="app2" ref-type="sec">Figure S4</xref>).</p>
        <p>Further examination indicated that mCPP induced FOS-IR in 91% of neurons in the IML staining for choline acetyltransferase (ChAT), the enzyme required for acetylcholine synthesis in sympathetic preganglionic neurons, in WT mice (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figures 3</xref>G–3I) but in &lt;1% of ChAT neurons in <italic>Mc4r</italic> KO mice. In other regions associated with autonomic outflow, such as the paraventricular, ventromedial, dorsomedial, and lateral nuclei of the hypothalamus, the dorsal motor nucleus of the vagus (DMV), and the nucleus of the solitary tract, no difference in FOS-IR induction in response to mCPP treatment was observed between <italic>Mc4r</italic> KO and WT mice (<xref rid="app2" ref-type="sec">Figure S5</xref>). We therefore conclude that IML MC4R activation is an important component of 5-HT<sub>2C</sub>R agonist-induced stimulation of the sympathetic nervous system (SNS). Nevertheless, potential caveats should be considered when interpreting these findings. For example, it is formally possible that MC4R deficiency affects basal and stimulus-induced activity specifically of IML sympathetic preganglionic neurons. It is also possible, given the widespread distribution of 5-HT<sub>2C</sub>Rs in the brain that include autonomic premotor sites, that administration of higher concentrations of 5-HT<sub>2C</sub>R agonists will activate non-MC4R-related pathways that provide inputs to preganglionic neurons influencing SNS activity. Thereby, conditions of MC4R-independent 5-HT<sub>2C</sub>R agonist-induced stimulation of the SNS would be achieved.</p>

        <title>5-HT<sub>2C</sub>R Agonists Improve Peripheral Insulin Action via MC4Rs</title>
        <p>To further characterize the effect of 5-HT<sub>2C</sub>R agonists on insulin action, we compared insulin-induced phosphorylation of protein kinase B (PKB) in quadriceps muscle, liver, and epididymal white adipose tissue (WAT) in DIO mice pretreated with saline or mCPP (1 mg/kg, i.p.) before administration of saline or insulin (0.5 U/kg, i.p). mCPP significantly enhanced PKB phosphorylation in response to insulin in liver (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>A; F(3,26) = 9.0, p &lt; 0.001) and muscle (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>B; F(3,26), p &lt; 0.01), but not WAT (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>C), where significant insulin-induced PKB phosphorylation in the absence of mCPP (F(3,26) = 4.1, p &lt; 0.05) may have precluded observation of a similar enhancement. To determine whether this effect is MC4R mediated, skeletal muscle was collected from insulinemia-matched DIO WT, DIO <italic>Mc3r</italic> KO, and <italic>Mc4r</italic> KO mice pretreated with saline or mCPP (1 mg/kg, i.p.) prior to an insulin load (0.5 U/kg, i.p.). mCPP significantly increased phosphorylation of PKB in both DIO WT (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>D; t(4) = 3.8, p &lt; 0.05) and DIO <italic>Mc3r</italic> KO (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>D; t(5) = 5.6, p &lt; 0.01) mice, an effect absent in <italic>Mc4r</italic> KO mice. These findings are concordant with the significant improvements in glucose tolerance, insulin tolerance, and fasting hyperinsulinemia seen in DIO WT and DIO <italic>Mc3r</italic> KOs, but not in <italic>Mc4r</italic> KOs, after mCPP treatment (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref> and <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>). Furthermore, we also observed that prolonged treatment with mCPP (1 mg/kg/day for 7 days, s.c. osmotic minipump) significantly reduced levels of hepatic phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PEPCK; <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>E; t(8) = 3.8, p &lt; 0.05) and glucose 6-phosphatase (G6P; <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>F; t(8) = 6.9, p &lt; 0.05) mRNA compared to saline treatment, providing further evidence for hepatic insulin sensitization by 5-HT<sub>2C</sub>R agonist treatment.</p>
        <p>Overall, these data support a model wherein 5-HT<sub>2C</sub>R agonists improve glucose homeostasis via increased production and release of endogenous melanocortin agonists, with subsequent activation of sympathetic preganglionic neurons in the IML via stimulation of MC4Rs. While we provide evidence for enhanced insulin sensitivity in response to 5-HT<sub>2C</sub>R agonists, it remains possible that the observed improved glucose tolerance is a composite of enhanced insulin secretion and enhanced insulin action in target tissues, though the relative contributions of these remain to be determined. The potential of 5-HT<sub>2C</sub>R agonists to address both cardinal pathogenic features of type 2 diabetes mellitus—insulin resistance and β cell failure—is intriguing.</p>
        <p>In summary, the identification of new classes of antidiabetic agents is a clinical imperative. The findings presented here identify a novel therapeutic application for a class of pharmacological compounds developed more than two decades ago. We demonstrate that 5-HT<sub>2C</sub>R agonists significantly improve glucose tolerance and hyperinsulinemia in murine models of obesity and type 2 diabetes via an MC4R-dependent mechanism. These findings not only delineate specific neuronal pathways of relevance to a highly prevalent metabolic disease but also suggest that 5-HT<sub>2C</sub>R agonists may prove an effective and mechanistically novel treatment for type 2 diabetes.</p>

        <p>5-HT<sub>2C</sub>R Agonists Improve Glucose Homeostasis and Upregulate POMC mRNA without Affecting Food Intake or Body Weight</p>
        <p>(A–D) Treatment-induced changes in fasting plasma insulin and blood glucose, daily food intake, and body weight were assessed in diet-induced obese (DIO) mice (n = 10) treated with saline or mCPP (1 mg/kg/day). Compared to pretreatment levels (white bars, day −2), prolonged mCPP infusion (black bars, day 14) significantly reduced fasting plasma insulin (A) without altering blood glucose (B). This concentration of mCPP (•) had no discernable effect on food intake (C) or body weight (D) compared to saline treatment (○).</p>
        <p>(E) DIO mice (n = 12, mean body weight = 37 g) fasted for 12 hrs and then treated with a single injection of mCPP (1 mg/kg, i.p.; •) 45 min prior to a glucose load (1 g/kg, i.p.) showed significantly improved glucose tolerance compared to saline (○), an effect blocked by pretreatment with the 5-HT<sub>2C</sub>R antagonist RS102221 (RS; 1 mg/kg, i.p.) 30 min prior to mCPP treatment (◇). RS102221 alone (♦) had no significant effect on glucose tolerance.</p>
        <p>(F) <italic>ob/ob</italic> mice (n = 6, mean body weight = 52 g, mean blood glucose = 304 mg/dl) treated with BVT.X (40 mg/kg/day; black bar) for 7 days showed a significant enhancement of ARC POMC mRNA expression and a reduction in fasting plasma insulin levels compared to saline-treated counterparts (white bar).</p>
        <p>(G and H) A single injection of mCPP (1 mg/kg, i.p.; •) in 12 hr-fasted DIO mice (n = 36, mean body weight = 38 g) 45 min prior to a glucose (1 g/kg, i.p.) (G) or insulin (0.5 U/kg insulin) (H) load improved glucose and insulin tolerance compared to saline treatment (○), an effect blocked by pretreatment with the MC3R/MC4R antagonist SHU9119 (0.1 nmol, i.c.v.) 30 min prior to mCPP treatment (◇). SHU9119 alone (♦) had no significant effect on glucose or insulin tolerance.</p>

        <p>(F–H) In contrast, <italic>Mc4r</italic> KO mice (n = 12, mean body weight = 60 g) treated with mCPP (black bars or •) showed no differences in plasma insulin (F), fasting blood glucose (G), or glucose tolerance (H) following a glucose load (1 g/kg, i.p.) compared to pretreatment values or saline treatment (white bars or ○).</p>
        <p>(I and J) A single injection of mCPP (•) was similarly ineffective in altering glucose tolerance following a glucose (1 g/kg, i.p.) (I) or insulin (0.5 U/kg insulin, i.p.)

        <p>Effect of 5-HT<sub>2C</sub>R Agonists on Insulin Signaling</p>
        <p>(A–C) A single injection of mCPP (1 mg/kg, i.p.) 45 min prior to insulin (0.5 U/kg, i.p.; gray bars) significantly increased Ser473 phosphorylation of PKB in liver (A) and skeletal muscle (B), but not white adipose tissue (WAT) (C), compared to saline treatment in 12 hr-fasted DIO mice (n = 30, mean body weight = 37 g). Representative western blots are displayed above each bar graph.</p>
        <p>(D) Supporting a role for the MC4Rs in this effect, DIO WT and DIO <italic>Mc3r</italic> KO mice (n = 16, mean body weight = 42 g) treated with mCPP (1 mg/kg, i.p.; black bars) displayed a similar augmentation of insulin (0.5 U/kg, i.p.)-induced Ser473 phosphorylation of PKB in muscle compared to saline-treated counterparts (white bars), an effect absent in <italic>Mc4r</italic> KO mice.</p>
        <p>(E and F) Moreover, prolonged treatment with mCPP (1 mg/kg/day for 7 days, s.c. minipump) significantly reduced PEPCK (E) and G6P (F) mRNA expression in the liver of DIO mice (n = 10, mean body weight = 36 g). AU, arbitrary units.</p>
