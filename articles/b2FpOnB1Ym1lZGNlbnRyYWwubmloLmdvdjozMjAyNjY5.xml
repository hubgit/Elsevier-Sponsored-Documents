        <title>Summary</title>
        <sec>
          <p>Chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) is caused by the constitutively active tyrosine kinase Bcr-Abl and treated with the tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) imatinib. However, emerging TKI resistance prevents complete cure. Therefore, alternative strategies targeting regulatory modules of Bcr-Abl in addition to the kinase active site are strongly desirable. Here, we show that an intramolecular interaction between the SH2 and kinase domains in Bcr-Abl is both necessary and sufficient for high catalytic activity of the enzyme. Disruption of this interface led to inhibition of downstream events critical for CML signaling and, importantly, completely abolished leukemia formation in mice. Furthermore, disruption of the SH2-kinase interface increased sensitivity of imatinib-resistant Bcr-Abl mutants to TKI inhibition. An engineered Abl SH2-binding fibronectin type III monobody inhibited Bcr-Abl kinase activity both in vitro and in primary CML cells, where it induced apoptosis. This work validates the SH2-kinase interface as an allosteric target for therapeutic intervention.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>The deregulated, constitutively activated tyrosine kinase Bcr-Abl is expressed from the Philadelphia chromosome after the t(9;22) chromosomal translocation that leads to the fusion of the <italic>breakpoint cluster region</italic> (<italic>BCR</italic>) gene and the <italic>Abelson tyrosine kinase</italic> (<italic>ABL1</italic>) (<xref rid="bib36" ref-type="bibr">Wong and Witte, 2004</xref>). The defining molecular event of chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) in humans is the expression of Bcr-Abl, which is sufficient for the initiation and maintenance of CML-like disease in mouse models (<xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr">Daley et al., 1990</xref>). Bcr-Abl activates a large number of signaling pathways that lead to uncontrolled proliferation, inhibition of apoptosis, and block of myeloid differentiation. Many of these pathways are thought to act in a redundant fashion, as only a few signaling components have thus been reported to be critical for Bcr-Abl-mediated oncogenic transformation. These included the transcription factors STAT5 and Myc, as well as the adaptor protein Gab2 (<xref rid="bib22 bib11 bib29" ref-type="bibr">Nieborowska-Skorska et al., 1999; Hoelbl et al., 2010; Sattler et al., 2002</xref>).</p>
      <p>Inhibition of Bcr-Abl tyrosine kinase activity by the highly specific Bcr-Abl inhibitor imatinib (Gleevec) leads to durable cytogenetic and molecular remissions in the majority of CML patients in the early chronic phase of the disease and is superior to previous therapies in advanced stage CML (<xref rid="bib10 bib4" ref-type="bibr">Hochhaus et al., 2009; Deininger et al., 2005</xref>). The occurrence of imatinib resistance—mainly caused by point mutations in the Bcr-Abl kinase domain—leads to patient relapse, bears the risk of disease progression, and resulted in the development and rapid approval of the second-generation inhibitors nilotinib and dasatinib that target most imatinib-resistant Bcr-Abl variants (<xref rid="bib31 bib25" ref-type="bibr">Shah and Sawyers, 2003; Quintás-Cardama et al., 2007</xref>). However, unsatisfactory responses in advanced disease stages, resistance, and problematic long-term tolerability of all three Bcr-Abl inhibitors remain major clinical problems (<xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr">Jabbour et al., 2010</xref>). All approaches aimed at targeting the ATP-binding pocket of the Bcr-Abl kinase domain alone do not target the disease-initiating leukemic stem cells, and thus, patients are not cured from CML (<xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr">Perrotti et al., 2010</xref>). Combination therapy of imatinib with drugs that target downstream signaling components of Bcr-Abl yielded promising results in preclinical studies (reviewed in <xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">Deininger et al., 2005</xref>). Still, these approaches have currently not been followed up further, as restoration of Bcr-Abl activity by resistance mutations appears to be dominant and override additive or synergistic inhibitory effects of the second drug (<xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">Deininger et al., 2005</xref>). For these reasons, approaches to target additional sites on Bcr-Abl itself in combination with the commonly targeted ATP-binding pocket may result in superior future therapeutic options.</p>
      <p>Studies on the structure and dynamics of c-Abl/Bcr-Abl regulation have identified key regulatory mechanisms (reviewed in <xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">Hantschel and Superti-Furga, 2004</xref>). Binding of the N-terminal myristate moiety to a unique binding pocket in the c-Abl kinase domain was found to be critical for autoinhibition (<xref rid="bib8 bib20" ref-type="bibr">Hantschel et al., 2003, Nagar et al., 2003</xref>). The myristate pocket was targeted by the non-ATP-competitive compound GNF-2/GNF-5 that led to inhibition of pan-TKI resistant Bcr-Abl variant T315I in a mouse model in combination with nilotinib (<xref rid="bib37" ref-type="bibr">Zhang et al., 2010</xref>).</p>
      <p>SH2 domains constitute one of the largest families of eukaryotic protein-protein interaction domains and bind phosphotyrosine moieties with a certain sequence specificity (<xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr">Pawson et al., 2001</xref>). Aside from their well-described role in mediating intermolecular protein interactions, the SH2 domains in certain cytoplasmic tyrosine kinases, like c-Abl and Fes, were shown to activate the adjacent tyrosine kinase domain (<xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">Filippakopoulos et al., 2008</xref>). The ability of the Abl SH2 to stimulate kinase activity was dependent on the establishment of a tight interface between the SH2 domain and the N-terminal lobe of the kinase domain (<xref rid="bib5 bib21" ref-type="bibr">Filippakopoulos et al., 2008; Nagar et al., 2006</xref>). Mutations in the SH2 domain that disrupt this SH2-kinase domain interface resulted in severe impairment of kinase activity. Thus, correct positioning of the SH2 and kinase domain modules appears to be critical for efficient activation of cytoplasmic tyrosine kinases (<xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">Filippakopoulos et al., 2008</xref>).</p>
      <p>In the oncogenic fusion Bcr-Abl, the Bcr moiety contains important regulatory elements that contribute to constitutive activation and cellular transformation. The Grb2 docking site (Tyr177 in Bcr) and the coiled-coil oligomerization domain were shown to support Bcr-Abl leukemogenicity (<xref rid="bib17 bib19" ref-type="bibr">McWhirter et al., 1993; Million and Van Etten, 2000</xref>). Therefore, whether or not SH2-mediated allosteric activation of the kinase domain is operable on the already highly activated Bcr-Abl fusion kinase or even affects its leukemogenicity were entirely unclear. Therefore, we set out to understand the functional role of the SH2-kinase domain interface in the context of Bcr-Abl.</p>
      <p>The data presented here show that the SH2-kinase domain interface is critical for Bcr-Abl activity both in vitro and in cells. Disruption of this interface abolished the development of CML in a mouse bone marrow transplantation model and enhanced TKI sensitivity of nonmutated and TKI-resistant Bcr-Abl forms. Finally, an engineered high-affinity Abl SH2 domain-binding protein targeted to the SH2-kinase interface was found to strongly inhibit Bcr-Abl activity in vitro and to induce apoptosis in CML cell lines as well as in primary CML cells, demonstrating the potential druggability of this interface.</p>

        <title>Ile164 Is a Critical Residue for the Integrity of the Active Conformation of Bcr-Abl</title>
        <p>The SH2 domain is thought to act as an intramolecular allosteric activator of the tyrosine kinase domain in the protooncogenic kinases Fes and c-Abl (<xref rid="bib5 bib6" ref-type="bibr">Filippakopoulos et al., 2008, 2009</xref>). Recently, a mutation of threonine 231 (Thr231) in the SH2 domain of the Bcr-Abl protein was identified in imatinib-treated patients and implicated in causing imatinib resistance (<xref rid="bib33" ref-type="bibr">Sherbenou et al., 2010</xref>). The T231R mutation may stabilize the SH2-kinase domain interface by the formation of an additional ionic interaction with Glu294 in the N lobe of the kinase domain (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>A and <xref rid="bib33" ref-type="bibr">Sherbenou et al., 2010</xref>). In contrast, mutation of isoleucine 164 (Ile164), located in the αA-βB-loop of the Abl SH2 domain, to glutamate (I164E) may nullify the allosteric activation of the Abl kinase by the SH2 domain by disrupting the SH2-kinase domain interface (<xref rid="bib5 bib21" ref-type="bibr">Filippakopoulos et al., 2008; Nagar et al., 2006</xref> and <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>A). These two observations may suggest a possible role of the Bcr-Abl SH2-kinase domain interface for the activity of the oncoprotein and even in CML pathobiology.</p>
        <p>We introduced the I164E and T231R single mutations and the I164E/T231R double mutation into Bcr-Abl. Upon expression in HEK293 cells, global tyrosine phosphorylation, Bcr-Abl autophosphorylation (on Tyr412 in the activation loop and on Tyr245 in the SH2-kinase linker), and in vitro tyrosine kinase activity were reduced in the I164E but increased in the T231R mutant. The I164E mutation was dominant over the T231R mutation, consistent with the proposed disrupting effect of the I164E mutation versus the stabilizing role of the T231R mutation (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figures 1</xref>B and 1C). In contrast, levels of phosphorylated Tyr177 in the Bcr part of Bcr-Abl, a site thought to be phosphorylated by Src kinases, were slightly higher in the T231R mutant. This might suggest higher Src activity in the presence of the T231R mutation (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>B).</p>
        <p>To study the structural role of Ile164 in more detail, we mutated Ile164 to different polar/charged amino acids (Glu, Gln, Thr, Asp, or Lys) or to Ala. All mutations led to a strong reduction of Abl autophosphorylation and in vitro kinase activity. Somewhat weaker effects were observed by mutating Ile164 to structurally related hydrophobic amino acids (Val or Leu) (<xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Figure S1</xref> available online).</p>
        <p>In enzyme-kinetic experiments, the Bcr-Abl I164E mutant protein displayed a &gt;3-fold reduction in v<sub>max</sub> compared to Bcr-Abl wild-type (WT) and a modest increase in Michaelis-Menten constant (K<sub>M</sub>) when assayed in vitro using an optimal Abl substrate peptide containing one single tyrosine (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>A).</p>

        <p>SH2 domain-containing tyrosine kinases have been proposed to use their SH2 domains to bind primed substrates to facilitate multisite (processive) phosphorylation of substrates with multiple tyrosine phosphorylation sites (<xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr">Mayer et al., 1995</xref>). Upon cotransfection of the Bcr-Abl substrate paxillin with Bcr-Abl I164E, we observed a strong reduction in multisite phosphorylation of paxillin, whereas the T231R mutation had the opposite effect (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figures 2</xref>B and <xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">S1</xref>). These data indicate that disruption of the SH2-kinase domain interface also influences the cellular activity of Bcr-Abl.</p>
        <p>As the canonical function of the SH2 domain is phosphotyrosine binding, we analyzed whether the I164E mutation would interfere with phosphopeptide-SH2 interactions (<xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr">Pawson et al., 2001</xref>). Recombinant WT and I164E-mutated Abl SH2 domains displayed indistinguishable low micromolar binding constants for an optimal Abl SH2-domain phoshopeptide ligand (<xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">Figure S2</xref>). In contrast, Abl SH2 domains bearing the FLV<underline>R</underline>E<underline>S</underline> mutants R171L or S173N were unable to bind tyrosine-phosphorylated peptides (<xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">Figure S2</xref> and data not shown). Together these data show that the I164E mutant does not compromise phosphotyrosine binding or structural integrity of the SH2 domain. Nonetheless, in the context of full-length Abl kinase, the I164E mutant was as defective as the FLVRE<underline>S</underline> mutant S173N in multisite phosphorylation of paxillin (<xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">Figure S2</xref>). This shows that aside from the intrinsic reduction in in vitro and cellular kinase activity, disruption of the SH2-kinase interface also interferes with multisite phosphorylation of Abl substrates, even though the phosphotyrosine peptide-binding properties of the SH2 domain are retained in Abl I164E. In addition, this indicates that the correct positioning of the SH2 domain may just be as important as the ability of the SH2 domain to bind primed tyrosine-phosphorylated substrates for further rounds of phosphorylation.</p>

        <title>Induced Tethering of the SH2 Domain to the Kinase Domain Activates Abl and Depends on Ile164</title>
        <p>In order to assess its potential for pharmacological exploitation, we further investigated the molecular mechanism of the positive effect of the SH2 domain on kinase activity. We made use of the FKBP-FRB fusion protein system, in which the SH2 and kinase domains of Abl are expressed separately but can be induced to physically associate upon addition of rapamycin (<xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr">Belshaw et al., 1996</xref>) (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>C). Induced tethering of the Abl SH2 domain to the Abl kinase domain led to an unexpectedly strong increase in phosphorylation of cotransfected paxillin and in total cellular tyrosine phosphorylation (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>C). The effect was reliant on the presence of both protein components and on the dimerization-inducing drug. Importantly, this effect was entirely dependent on the SH2-kinase interface, as mutation of Ile164 abolished the stimulatory effect. This provided conclusive evidence that docking of the SH2 domain is sufficient for the observed positive allosteric effect on kinase activity and could thus represent a targetable interaction.</p>

        <title>The Bcr-Abl SH2-Kinase Interface Is Critical for the Transformation of Primary Murine Hematopoietic Cells and Leukemia Formation In Vivo</title>
        <p>We next determined whether mutation of the SH2-kinase domain interface had an effect on oncogenic transformation and leukemogenicity. Primary murine bone marrow hematopoietic cells transduced with Bcr-Abl WT were able to form colonies in the absence of cytokines in semisolid media (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>A). In contrast, this transforming capability was dramatically reduced in cells expressing Bcr-Abl I164E (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>A).</p>
        <p>We then tested whether this reduction was also manifest in an in vivo model of Bcr-Abl-induced leukemia (<xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr">Daley et al., 1990</xref>). Equal numbers of Bcr-Abl WT- and Bcr-Abl I164E-transduced hematopoietic stem cells were injected into lethally irradiated recipient mice. Mice transplanted with Bcr-Abl-expressing cells developed an aggressive myeloproliferative disorder, leading to death of all animals within 3 weeks (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>B). These mice displayed massively infiltrated spleen and liver and loss of normal organ architecture (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>C). In contrast, all mice transplanted with Bcr-Abl I164E-expressing cells remained alive for the 120 days of the study (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>B). After this period, no obvious pathological alterations in the liver or spleen were detected despite confirmation of the presence of Bcr-Abl I164E-transduced cells in all lineages in peripheral blood, bone marrow, and spleen (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figures 3</xref>C and 3D and data not shown). On one hand, this indicates a lack of oncogenic properties of Bcr-Abl I164E that are necessary to induce a fatal leukemia, but it rules out a possible defect in engraftment and/or hematopoietic differentiation caused by the I164E mutation. Together, our results indicate a crucial role for the SH2-kinase domain interface in Bcr-Abl-mediated leukemic transformation.</p>

        <title>Bcr-Abl I164E Confers Growth-Factor Independence to Ba/F3 and UT-7 Cells despite Reduced Kinase Activity</title>
        <p>To assess cellular effects and downstream signaling of the Bcr-Abl I164E mutation, we engineered the murine IL-3-dependent cell line Ba/F3 and the human GM-CSF-dependent cell line UT-7 to express Bcr-Abl WT and Bcr-Abl I164E. In both cell lines, we consistently observed higher expression levels of Bcr-Abl I164E as compared to Bcr-Abl WT, despite equal virus titers used (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>A and data not shown). Nevertheless, global tyrosine phosphorylation was still lower in cells expressing Bcr-Abl I164E (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>A). Single-cell clone pairs, initially selected for equal expression levels of Bcr-Abl WT and I164E, quickly showed increased Bcr-Abl I164E expression within a few passages (data not shown).</p>
        <p>A widely used read-out of Bcr-Abl activity is the ability to confer cytokine-independent growth to Ba/F3 or UT-7 cells. Despite the complete lack of leukemogenic activity of Bcr-Abl I164E (see <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>), we observed that Bcr-Abl I164E was equally potent in transforming Ba/F3 or UT-7 cell lines to cytokine independence (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>B). A possible explanation is that the reduced kinase activity of the I164E mutant may be compensated by upregulation of the Bcr-Abl mutant protein levels in order to allow cytokine-independent proliferation of hematopoietic cell lines.</p>

        <title>Analysis of Downstream Signaling Pathways</title>
        <p>It is surprising that a single point mutation located outside of the tyrosine kinase domain and not affecting phosphotyrosine binding of the SH2 domain could have such a dramatic effect on the oncogenic activity of Bcr-Abl. Given this crucial function, we investigated the downstream signaling events that may be involved. We tested some major phosphorylation events in Ba/F3 cells, as well as in human U937 cells. As already observed in HEK293 cells, mutation of Ile164 led to a strong reduction of global tyrosine phosphorylation and phosphorylation of Tyr412 in the activation loop of Bcr-Abl (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figures 4</xref>A and 4D). Important signaling mediators downstream of Bcr-Abl include the phosphorylation and activation of STAT5, Akt, and Erk1/2 (<xref rid="bib26" ref-type="bibr">Ren, 2005</xref>). We observed a strong reduction in tyrosine phosphorylation of STAT5 and CrkL in cells expressing Bcr-Abl I164E as compared to Bcr-Abl WT (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figures 4</xref>C, 4D, and <xref rid="figs3" ref-type="fig">S3</xref>). As activation of STAT5 is required for the induction and maintenance of CML by Bcr-Abl (<xref rid="bib22 bib11" ref-type="bibr">Nieborowska-Skorska et al., 1999; Hoelbl et al., 2010</xref>), it is tempting to speculate that the inability of Bcr-Abl I164E to induce CML may mainly be caused by its inability to activate STAT5.</p>
        <p>Surprisingly, despite the strong effect on Bcr-Abl activity, the I164E mutation had no effect on Erk1/2 and Akt phosphorylation or other MAPK or PI3K pathway members (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figures 4</xref>C and 4D and data not shown). This is in line with comparable levels of phosphorylated Tyr177 in Bcr-Abl, which was shown to be critical for PI3K and MAPK pathway activation (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>B) (<xref rid="bib29" ref-type="bibr">Sattler et al., 2002</xref>). Thus, interference with the SH2-kinase domain interface appears to result in a complex rewiring of the signaling network with specific downregulated events rather than general attenuation of signaling, suggesting that uncoupling of the SH2-kinase module may generate a not only quantitatively but also qualitatively impaired abnormal Bcr-Abl output. Furthermore, these data are consistent with different thresholds in Bcr-Abl activity that are required for full signaling output, with STAT5 activation being a critical event that is highly sensitive to disruption of the SH2-kinase domain interface.</p>

        <title>Disruption of the SH2-Kinase Domain Interface Sensitizes Bcr-Abl WT and Drug-Resistant Forms to TKI Inhibition</title>
        <p>Pharmacological interference with the SH2-kinase domain interaction surface would be particularly attractive if it could alter the sensitivity of Bcr-Abl to existing TKIs. We tested the sensitivity of Bcr-Abl I164E toward the CML TKIs imatinib and dasatinib in in vitro kinase assays (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figures 5</xref>A and 5B). Whereas imatinib and nilotinib exclusively bind Bcr-Abl when its activation loop is not phosphorylated, binding of dasatinib requires an active conformation (<xref rid="bib30 bib34" ref-type="bibr">Schindler et al., 2000; Vajpai et al., 2008</xref>). Therefore, different sensitivities to the two classes have been used by others and us to monitor different conformational states of the target enzymes (<xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">De Keersmaecker et al., 2008</xref>). We observed a 4-fold increase in sensitivity of Bcr-Abl I164E for imatinib, whereas no differences were observed in response to dasatinib (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figures 5</xref>A and 5B). In line with this, the sensitivity of Ba/F3 cells expressing Bcr-Abl I164E for nilotinib was increased 3-fold (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref>C). We next addressed whether disruption of the SH2-kinase domain interface also sensitized TKI-resistant mutants to nilotinib inhibition. Introduction of the I164E mutation in the imatinib-resistant Bcr-Abl clones H396R or E255K also increased the nilotinib sensitivity of these mutants 3-fold (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref>D and data not shown).</p>
        <p>The T315I mutation in Bcr-Abl is the only mutation that is resistant to imatinib, nilotinib, and dasatinib. At concentrations that only marginally inhibited Bcr-Abl T315I, nilotinib caused a dramatic reduction in the in vitro tyrosine kinase activity in the Bcr-Abl T315I/I164E double mutant (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref>E). Finally, the I164E mutation also increased the sensitivity of Bcr-Abl T315I-expressing Ba/F3 cells toward the allosteric myristate-binding pocket inhibitor GNF-2 (<xref rid="bib37" ref-type="bibr">Zhang et al., 2010</xref> and <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref>F). These results extend the recently proposed cooperativity between the myristate pocket and the ATP-binding site (<xref rid="bib37" ref-type="bibr">Zhang et al., 2010</xref>) to the SH2-kinase domain interface and indicate that disruption of the SH2-kinase domain interface not only sensitizes Bcr-Abl WT to imatinib/nilotinib but could also be used to enhance inhibition of TKI-resistant Bcr-Abl mutants.</p>

        <title>Targeting of the Bcr-Abl SH2-Kinase Interface using Monobodies</title>
        <p>To test whether the SH2-kinase interface can be targeted using an inhibitor in <italic>trans</italic>, we generated single-domain binding proteins based on the fibronectin type III domain (FN3), termed monobodies, that target the Abl SH2 domain (<xref rid="bib15 bib35" ref-type="bibr">Koide and Koide, 2007; Wojcik et al., 2010</xref>). We have previously described the Abl SH2-binding monobody HA4, which acts as a competitive inhibitor of phosphotyrosine binding (<xref rid="bib35" ref-type="bibr">Wojcik et al., 2010</xref>). Using HA4 as a competitor in phage-disply library sorting, we identified an Abl SH2 monobody, designated 7c12, that bound to a distinct site. 7c12 binds the Abl SH2 domain with a dissociation constant (K<sub>D</sub>) of ∼50 nM (<xref rid="figs4" ref-type="fig">Figure S4</xref> and data not shown). In in vitro kinase assays, 7c12 inhibited kinase activity of Bcr-Abl WT and T315I, but not of Bcr-Abl I164E or Bcr-Abl T315I/I164E (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figures 6</xref>A and <xref rid="figs4" ref-type="fig">S4</xref>). Although the effect was mild, it was statistically significant and did not occur with a recombinant control protein, which does not bind the Abl SH2 domain. This suggested a possible involvement of the Bcr-Abl SH2-kinase domain interface in 7c12 binding. In fact, the I164E mutation reduced binding of 7c12 by a factor of ∼400 (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6</xref>B).</p>

        <title>Crystal Structure of the Abl SH2 Domain-7c12 Monobody Complex</title>
        <p>To elucidate the molecular details of the 7c12-Abl SH2 interaction, we determined the crystal structure of the complex at 2.1 Å resolution (PDB ID: 3T04; <xref rid="mmc1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Table S1</xref>; <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figures 6</xref>C and <xref rid="figs5" ref-type="fig">S5</xref>). The asymmetric unit consists of a single monobody-SH2 domain complex (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figures 6</xref>C and <xref rid="figs5" ref-type="fig">S5</xref>A). The 7c12 monobody and the Abl SH2 domain contribute nearly equally to the ∼1340 Å<sup>2</sup> of surface area buried in the complex. The diversified loops contribute nearly 75% of the binding interface with each of the three loops making substantial contributions (91, 178, and 234 Å<sup>2</sup> for the BC, DE, and FG loops, respectively). The D strand of the monobody scaffold also makes substantial contribution to the interface. It packs against the C-terminal tail of the SH2 domain through an intermolecular β sheet (<xref rid="figs5" ref-type="fig">Figure S5</xref>A, red box and <xref rid="figs5" ref-type="fig">S5</xref>B). Outside of these backbone-mediated interactions, the interface is dominated by hydrophobic contacts between monobody loop residues and two surface concavities on either side of β strand B of the SH2 domain. At the end of the monobody D strand, the DE loop forms a hairpin that packs against one of these concave surfaces that is formed by the βB strand and the αA helix of the Abl SH2 domain (<xref rid="figs5" ref-type="fig">Figure S5</xref>C). Pro60 and Tyr62 make most of the DE loop contacts, together burying more than 150 Å<sup>2</sup> of surface area.</p>
        <p>The second surface concavity is bounded on one side by β strand B of the Abl SH2 domain, on the other by α helix B, and from above and below by the N-terminal and C-terminal tails of the Abl SH2 domain (<xref rid="figs5" ref-type="fig">Figure S5</xref>A, cyan box). Phe87 of the 7c12 FG loop penetrates deep into the center of this pocket, burying 133 Å<sup>2</sup> of surface area on its own. Other residues in the FG loop (Phe88, Pro89), Val38, and the aliphatic portion of Lys39 of the BC loop form a ring of hydrophobic contacts at the periphery of this surface pocket (<xref rid="figs5" ref-type="fig">Figure S5</xref>D). Together, these residues contribute nearly 300 Å<sup>2</sup> to total monobody surface area burial.</p>
        <p>The interface observed in the crystal structure is also consistent with the strong negative effect of the I164E mutant on 7c12-SH2 interaction (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref>B). Ile164 is located at the edge of the 7c12-binding interface and contributes 29 Å<sup>2</sup> of surface to the interface. It makes hydrophobic interactions with Tyr62 of the DE loop (<xref rid="figs5" ref-type="fig">Figure S5</xref>C). These features rationalize the ∼400-fold reduction in binding affinity by the I164E mutation (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6</xref>B).</p>
        <p>In order to further confirm the authenticity of the interaction interface observed in the crystal structure, we used nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy to conduct epitope mapping. The Abl SH2 backbone amide resonances most greatly affected by the presence of 7c12, as measured in <sup>15</sup>N HSQC experiments, are in good agreement with portions of the SH2 domain that are contacted by 7c12 in the crystal structure (<xref rid="figs5" ref-type="fig">Figure S5</xref>F), suggesting that the interface observed in the crystal structure corresponds to the actual solution-phase interaction. To further validate the crystal structure using an independent experimental approach, we mutated each of the loop regions individually back to the template sequence and measured the binding affinity of these mutants. In each case, the mutant-Abl SH2 domain interaction was at least 100 times weaker than the wild-type 7c12-Abl SH2 interaction (data not shown). These results are consistent with the crystal structure, in which each loop makes a significant contribution to the 7c12-Abl SH2 interaction. Together, these studies provide significant validation of the observed crystal structure interface.</p>

        <title>Comparison of the 7c12-Abl SH2 Interface to the Abl SH2-Kinase Domain Interface</title>
        <p>We next compared the Abl SH2-kinase domain interface with the 7c12-Abl SH2 interface (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figures 6</xref>C and <xref rid="figs5" ref-type="fig">S5</xref>). The size of the SH2-kinase domain interface is ∼1030 Å<sup>2</sup>, ∼75% of that of the 7c12-Abl SH2 interface. More than half of the total surface area of the SH2-kinase interface overlaps with the 7c12-SH2 domain interface centered on β strand B of the Abl SH2 domain (<xref rid="figs5" ref-type="fig">Figures S5</xref>G and S5H). This significant overlap in the 7c12-Abl SH2 and Abl SH2-kinase interfaces strongly suggests that the binding of the SH2 domain to the kinase domain and to 7c12 are mutually exclusive (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figures 6</xref>C, <xref rid="figs5" ref-type="fig">S5</xref>G, and S5H). The incompatibility of simultaneous binding of the SH2 to both the kinase domain and 7c12, therefore, likely explains the observed inhibition of Bcr-Abl kinase activity, as full 7c12 binding requires the disruption of the SH2-kinase domain interface. Given the theoretical difficulty of competing intermolecularly with an ∼1100 Å<sup>2</sup> intramolecular protein-protein interaction and the partial occlusion of the 7c12-binding site on the SH2 domain by the kinase domain, we consider the degree of inhibition that is achieved by the 7c12 monobody to be symptomatic and strongly indicative of a specific vulnerability.</p>

        <title>Improved Targeting of the SH2 Interface with a Tandem Fusion of the HA4 and 7c12 Monobodies</title>
        <p>Despite the clear demonstration of the general feasibility of targeting the SH2-kinase interface using 7c12, we aimed at improving its biological potency. Superposition of the structure of the previously characterized HA4 monobody bound to the Abl SH2 domain (<xref rid="bib35" ref-type="bibr">Wojcik et al., 2010</xref>) with the 7c12-Abl SH2 structure reveals that the two monobodies bind on opposite faces of the SH2 domain with no overlap (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figures 6</xref>D and <xref rid="figs5" ref-type="fig">S5</xref>E). This arrangement is consistent with the selection scheme employed for the generation of 7c12, in which HA4 was used as a competitor, and with sandwich-ELISA data indicating that HA4 and 7c12 can bind simultaneously to the same Abl SH2 domain molecule (data not shown). HA4 binds with low nanomolar affinity to the phosphotyrosine-binding pocket of the Abl SH2 domain, which is not part of an intramolecular interaction in Bcr-Abl and is able to effectively outcompete phosphotyrosine ligand binding (<xref rid="bib35" ref-type="bibr">Wojcik et al., 2010</xref>). For these reasons, we attempted to link HA4 and 7c12 in tandem, which should increase the local concentration of 7c12 in proximity to the SH2-kinase domain interface and further enhance the specificity toward the Abl SH2 domain. A 19 amino acid Gly-Ser linker was used to bridge the C terminus of HA4 to the N terminus of 7c12, based on structural modeling (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6</xref>D). As negative controls, we introduced point mutations in both parts of the HA4-7c12 tandem monobody. For HA4, we used the Y88A (Y87A in the original numbering scheme) mutation that was previously shown to reduce binding to the Abl SH2 domain &gt;1000-fold (<xref rid="bib35" ref-type="bibr">Wojcik et al., 2010</xref>). We also designed a double point mutation (Y172E/F179K; Y62E/F87K in the original numbering scheme, <xref rid="figs5" ref-type="fig">Figure S5</xref>) for the 7c12 part, which is located at structurally central positions of the 7c12-Abl SH2 interface and showed a strong reduction in binding in pull-down experiments (data not shown). We tested the HA4-7c12 tandem monobody in Bcr-Abl in vitro kinase assays. We observed a strong inhibition of Bcr-Abl activity with low micromolar concentrations of the HA4-7c12 tandem monobody, whereas the nonbinding Y88A/Y172E/F179K mutant failed to inhibit Bcr-Abl activity (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6</xref>E). Importantly, the degree of inhibition of Bcr-Abl activity achieved by HA4-7c12 was comparable to that upon introduction of the I164E mutant (Figures <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>C and <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>A). HA4-7c12 was also able to inhibit Bcr-Abl T231R, although to a lesser degree than Bcr-Abl WT (<xref rid="figs6" ref-type="fig">Figure S6</xref>). This indicates that the tandem monobody may lead to a complete disruption of the Bcr-Abl kinase domain interface.</p>

        <title>The HA4-7c12 Tandem Monobody Strongly Inhibits Cellular Bcr-Abl Activity and Induces Apoptosis in CML Cells</title>
        <p>Finally, we tested whether the HA4-7c12 tandem monobody would also inhibit Bcr-Abl activity in CML cells. Transient expression of a HA4-7c12-GFP fusion protein in the Bcr-Abl-positive CML cell line K562 led to a strong reduction of activation loop (Tyr412) phosphorylation of Bcr-Abl (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7</xref>A). This effect was dependent on both HA4 and 7c12 moieties of the tandem monobody, as expression of point mutants that abolish binding of either HA4 (Y88A) or 7c12 (Y172E/F197K) or both to the Abl SH2 domain did not show this effect (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7</xref>A).</p>
        <p>We next tested whether the HA4-7c12-induced decrease in Bcr-Abl activity with HA4-7c12 would result in cell death. Indeed, K562 cells expressing the HA4-7c12 tandem monobody showed high amounts of apoptosis, as measured by TUNEL and cleaved caspase 3 staining (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figures 7</xref>B and <xref rid="figs7" ref-type="fig">S7</xref>A). Again, this effect was not evident when the nonbinding mutant was used.</p>
        <p>Next, we asked whether HA4-7c12 would inhibit Bcr-Abl-induced transformation of primary murine bone marrow cells. In contrast to the nonbinding mutants, bicistronic expression of Bcr-Abl and GFP-HA4-7c12 WT severely impaired cytokine-independent colony formation in semisolid media (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7</xref>C).</p>
        <p>Finally, we tested whether HA4-7c12 would induce apoptosis in primary bone marrow or peripheral blood cells from CML patients at different stages of the disease (<xref rid="mmc1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Table S2</xref>). Lentiviral expression of HA4-7c12 induced an ∼65% increase in apoptotic cells over the nonbinding mutant HA4 Y88A-7c12-Y172E/F197K in cells from patients in chronic phase (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7</xref>D, left panel). This increase was comparable to the induction of apoptosis upon treatment of the same cultures with 2 μM nilotinib for 5 days (41%). Similar results were obtained when cells from patients in the accelerated phase of the disease were used (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7</xref>D, right panel). Here, nilotinib treatment led to a 40% increase whereas expression of HA4-7c12 induced a 49% increase in apoptosis.</p>
        <p>Together, these data show that Bcr-Abl activity can be inhibited by targeting the SH2-kinase interface using FN3-based monobodies in CML cell lines, as well as in primary cells from CML patients.</p>

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>In this study, we have identified the SH2-kinase domain interface as a critical structural feature that is important for the adoption and maintenance of the active conformation of Bcr-Abl. We show that disruption of this interface completely abolishes Bcr-Abl leukemogenicity. Therefore, the SH2-kinase domain interface in Bcr-Abl represents an attractive “druggable” target in addition to its ATP- and myristate-binding sites. As a molecular tool, we developed the FN3-based monobody 7c12 and the tandem monobody HA4-7c12 that showed strong inhibition of Bcr-Abl activity in vitro and induced apoptosis in CML cells. The HA4-7c12 fusion is an example of the use of two FN3 monobodies in tandem to achieve a higher level of target inhibition. Although we show that lentiviral delivery of the HA4-7c12 cDNA was able to induce apoptosis in primary cells from CML patients, difficulties with intracellular delivery of the HA4-7c12 protein will most probably limit or preclude the use of monobodies as drug-like molecules in clinical applications. In contrast, the exquisite affinity and specificity of HA4-7c12 for Bcr-Abl suggest general utility of monobodies as target validation tools for preclinical studies.</p>
      <p>Recent data confirmed evidence for a positive role of the SH2 domain on the adjacent tyrosine kinase domain in selected cytoplasmic tyrosine kinases (<xref rid="bib5 bib18 bib14" ref-type="bibr">Filippakopoulos et al., 2008; Mikkola and Gahmberg, 2010; Joseph et al., 2007</xref>), originally identified in the v-Fps/Fes oncoprotein (<xref rid="bib28" ref-type="bibr">Sadowski et al., 1986</xref>). Despite this conserved allosteric regulatory property of the SH2 domain, the surfaces involved in establishing the interface between the SH2 domain and the tyrosine kinase domain N lobe appear to be diverse in terms of biophysical properties, size, and affinity among different tyrosine kinases. The underlying structural mechanism responsible for the activation of the Abl kinase domain by its SH2 domain is still elusive and should be the subject of an independent study. However, the I164E mutation disrupts the SH2-kinase domain interface while leaving the core function of the SH2 domain—binding of phosphotyrosine ligands—unaffected. Previous studies have attempted to address the role of the SH2 domain for oncogenic transformation and leukemogenicity of Bcr-Abl either by mutating the conserved Arg171 in the phosphotyrosine-binding pocket or by deleting the entire domain (<xref rid="bib12 bib27" ref-type="bibr">Ilaria and Van Etten, 1995; Roumiantsev et al., 2001</xref>). However, the widely used mutation of Arg171 is associated with a loss of the integrity of the SH2 domain (<xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Figure S1</xref> and data not shown). Therefore, as in the case of deletion of the entire domain, both the phosphotyrosine-binding function as well as the maintenance of the SH2-kinase domain interface are likely to be compromised upon introduction of the Arg171 mutation. Thus, the observed effects on transformation and leukemogenicity likely reflect a combination of multiple effects caused by interference with the protein architecture.</p>
      <p>As interference with the SH2-kinase domain interface leads to a dramatic reduction in Bcr-Abl activity, one would expect a uniform decrease in the activation of the major pathways that are activated by Bcr-Abl. Instead, we observed an almost exclusive loss of STAT5 activation. STAT5 is a central component that is required for the induction and maintenance of CML induced by Bcr-Abl (<xref rid="bib22 bib11" ref-type="bibr">Nieborowska-Skorska et al., 1999; Hoelbl et al., 2010</xref>). Therefore, it is tempting to speculate that the inability of Bcr-Abl I164E to induce CML is caused by its inability to activate STAT5. It has been shown that even short-term blockage of Bcr-Abl action resulted in severe and complete inhibition of STAT5 activity and target gene expression (<xref rid="bib32 bib9" ref-type="bibr">Shah et al., 2008; Hantschel et al., 2008</xref>). In contrast, other pathways, including the Ras-MAPK or the PI3K-Akt pathways, were not compromised strongly. This may be the reason that Bcr-Abl I164E, although not leukemogenic, may confer cytokine independence to Ba/F3 or UT-7 cells.</p>
      <p>Together, our work shows that interfering with the SH2-kinase domain interface can allosterically inhibit Bcr-Abl activity. It should be feasible to develop a small molecule that interferes with this SH2-kinase domain interaction. Such allosteric modulators could be of either antagonistic or agonistic nature depending on the targeted surface and binding mode. This may represent an attractive option for patients with chronic phase CML that only achieve a suboptimal response or are resistant to TKI therapy, as well as for patients with advanced stage CML or Ph-positive acute lymphoblastic leukemia.</p>

        <p>The I164E Mutation Does Not Interfere with the Phosphotyrosine-Binding Capability of the Abl SH2 Domain, Related to <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref></p>
        <p>(A) Fluorescence polarization binding assay of recombinant WT and mutant Abl SH2 domains to a fluorescently labeled tyrosine phosphorylated peptide (EPPVpYANLS). The recombinant Abl SH2 domain harboring the I164E mutation was found to bind a phosphorylated peptide with equal affinity as the wt Abl SH2 domain. In contrast, Abl SH2 domains bearing the FLV<underline>R</underline>E<underline>S</underline> mutants R171L or S173N were unable to bind tyrosine phosphorylated peptides.</p>
        <p>(B) HEK293 cells were transfected with expression constructs comprising the Abl kinase domain alone or the SH2-kinase domain module of c-Abl (Abl SH2-kinase domain WT, S173N, I164E). Constructs were immunoprecipitated and subjected to in vitro kinase assays in the presence of an optimal Abl substrate peptide containing a single tyrosine phosphorylation site. In line with previous results, the SH2 domain had a positive role on the kinase activity, as we observed higher kinase activity of the Abl SH2-kinase domain construct as compared to the Abl kinase domain alone, and introduction of the I164E reverted this effect. However, the phosphotyrosine-binding mutant S173N did not show significantly different kinase activity as compared to the WT Abl SH2-kinase domain construct. As the kinase substrate peptide used in this assay contains only one tyrosine residue, no (processive phosphorylation) effects dependent on the phosphotyrosine-binding capability of the Abl SH2 domain are observed. Together, these data rule out that the I164E mutation in the Abl SH2 domain leads to reduced kinase activity by interfering with phosphotyrosine binding of the SH2 domain. Furthermore, this experiment shows that the ability of the Abl SH2 domain to bind phosphotyrosine does not influence the in vitro kinase activity of the Abl kinase. Error bars represent SD.</p>
        <p>(C) HEK293 cells were transiently transfected with the indicated c-Abl mutants in the presence or absence of a HA-tagged form of the Abl substrate paxillin. Total cell lysates were subjected to immunoblot analysis using antibodies against Abl, HA and phosphotyrosine. HA-tagged paxillin was immunoprecipitated from the same lysates and subjected to immunoblotting using antibodies against phosphotyrosine and HA. The Abl substrate paxillin contains multiple tyrosine residues that can serve as substrates for Abl. Thus, basal phosphorylation of one tyrosine residue might exert a positive feedback to Abl activity that is mediated by the Abl SH2 domain by binding the first phosphotyrosine and thereby positioning another unphosphorylated tyrosine close to the active site of the kinase. This phenomenon is referred to as processive phosphorylation and is dependent on the capability of the SH2 domain to bind to tyrosine-phosphorylated substrates. Paxillin was efficiently tyrosine phosphorylated by the constitutively active form of Abl (Abl PP) in a processive way (phosphorylation on multiple tyrosine residues as indicated by the shift of the HA-reactive bands to higher molecular weight species). Both Abl PP I164E and Abl PP S173N were able to phosphorylate paxillin at basal levels but neither of the mutants induced efficient processive phosphorylation of this substrate. This phenotype can be explained by the inability of the S173N mutant to bind to tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins, while in the case of the I164E mutant, this could be attributed to the lower overall activity of the kinase caused by the loss of the positive allosteric effect of the SH2 domain, which is independent of phosphotyrosine binding. In addition, this may indicate that for the recognition of Abl substrates with multiple phosphorylation sites the correct positioning of the SH2 domain appears to be of equal importance.</p>

        <p>(E) Orthogonal views of HA4-Abl SH2 and 7c12sm-Abl SH2 complexes superimposed according to the coordinates of the SH2 domain common to both structures. HA4 is shown as the orange cartoon model, 7c12sm as the cyan cartoon model. The Abl SH2 domain is shown as a white surface model, with additional coloring as follows: HA4 interface residues (defined as Abl SH2 domain residues within 5 Å of a monobody) are colored in blue and 7c12sm interface residues are colored in yellow.</p>
        <p>(F) NMR epitope mapping of the 7c12sm interaction interface. 7c12sm is shown as cyan. Abl SH2 is shown as the white cartoon model, with individual residues as colored spheres. Red, yellow, and white spheres indicate the Cα atom positions for residues whose NMR signals are strongly affected, weakly affected, and not affected, respectively, by the binding of 7c12sm.</p>
        <p>(G) Abl SH2 is shown as a transparent white surface model with additional coloring as follows: red: surfaces contacted by the kinase domain; yellow: surfaces contacted by 7c12sm; orange: surfaces contacted by both 7c12sm and the kinase domain in their respective structures.</p>
        <p>(H) Close-up of (G) emphasizing the interface contacted by both the kinase domain and 7c12sm. The SH2 domain is also shown as a ribbon diagram beneath the transparent surface. Selected residues are highlighted as stick models. Kinase domain residues are shown with carbon atoms in white, nitrogen in blue, and oxygen in red and are labeled in black. 7c12-BC loop Q36 and V38 are labeled in blue, DE loop P60 and Y62 are in pink. Abl SH2 I164 is labeled in red, and shown as orange sticks. The αA, αB, and βB secondary structure elements of the Abl SH2 domain are labeled in black.</p>

        <p>The T231R Mutation in the SH2-Kinase Interface Partially Blocks Inhibition of Bcr-Abl Activity by the HA4-7c12 Tandem Monobody, Related to <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6</xref></p>
        <p>In vitro kinase activity of immunoprecipitated Bcr-Abl WT and T231R proteins was assayed in the presence of the indicated concentrations of recombinant HA4-7c12. The nonbinding mutant HA4 Y88A-7c12 Y173E/F197K was used as a control. Activity of each Bcr-Abl mutant-buffer control was normalized to 1. Significance levels are indicated (ns: not significant, <sup>∗</sup>p &lt; 0.05, <sup>∗∗</sup>p &lt; 0.01). Error bars represent SD.</p>

        <p>(A) K562 cells were transiently transfected with the indicated HA4-7c12-GFP fusion constructs and the levels of cleaved caspase 3 were measured 48 hr later using flow cytometry. Left panel: Histograms of fluorescence intensities of the GFP-positive fraction of cells transfected with the indicated constructs. Right panel: Quantitation of cleaved caspase-3-positive cells. The percentages were normalized to K562 cells treated with 3 μM Nilotinib for 24 hr (arbitrarily set to 100%, see C, right panel) and mock-transfected cells (no apoptosis—arbitrarily set to 0%) (n = 3). Error bars represent SD.</p>
        <p>(B) K562 cells were treated with 1 μM nilotinib for 3 hr or left untreated and Bcr-Abl activation loop phosphorylation (P-Tyr412) was measured by flow cytometry.</p>
        <p>(C) K562 cells were treated with 1 μM nilotinib for 24 hr or left untreated and apoptosis was measured by flow cytometry using TUNEL (left panel) or cleaved caspase 3 staining (right panel) according the manufacturer's instructions.</p>
        <p>(D) HA4-7c12 WT and the nonbinding mutant HA4 Y88A-7c12 Y173E/F197K were expressed in primary cells from CML patients (see <xref rid="mmc1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Table S2</xref> for patient characteristics) using lentiviral constructs expressing GFP as a marker. Seven days later, cells were fixed and analyzed for cleaved caspase 3-positive cells by FACS. Shown are percentages of apoptotic cells from the GFP-positive population.</p>
