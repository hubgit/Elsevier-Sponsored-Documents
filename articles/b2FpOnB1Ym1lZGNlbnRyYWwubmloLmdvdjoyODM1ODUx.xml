        <title>Summary</title>
        <sec>
          <title>Background</title>
          <p>In metastatic renal cell carcinoma combinations of interferon alfa-2a, interleukin-2, and fluorouracil produce higher response rates and longer progression-free survival than do single agents. We aimed to compare overall survival in patients receiving combination treatment or interferon alfa-2a.</p>
        </sec>
        <sec>
          <title>Methods</title>
          <p>RE04/30012 was an open-label randomised trial undertaken in 50 centres across eight countries. 1006 treatment-naive patients diagnosed with advanced metastatic renal cell carcinoma were randomly allocated (1 to 1) by minimisation to receive interferon alfa-2a alone or combination therapy with interferon alfa-2a, interleukin-2, and fluorouracil. Treatment was not masked. The primary endpoint was overall survival. Treatment groups were compared with a non-stratified log-rank test. Analysis was by intention to treat. This study is registered, number ISRCTN 46518965.</p>
        </sec>
        <sec>
          <title>Findings</title>
          <p>502 patients were randomly assigned to receive interferon alfa-2a and 504 to receive combined treatment. Median follow-up was 37·2 months (24·8–52·3). Median overall survival was 18·8 months (17·0–23·2) for patients receiving interferon alfa-2a versus 18·6 months (16·5–20·6) for those receiving combination therapy. Overall survival did not differ between the two groups (hazard ratio 1·05 [95% CI 0·90–1·21], p=0·55; absolute difference 0·3% (−5·1 to 5·6) at 1 year and 2·7% (−8·2 to 2·9) at 3 years). Serious adverse events were reported in 113 (23%) patients receiving interferon alfa-2a and 131 (26%) of those receiving combined treatment.</p>
        </sec>
        <sec>
          <title>Interpretation</title>
          <p>Although combination therapy does not improve overall or progression-free survival compared with interferon alfa-2a alone, immunotherapy might still have a role because it can produce remissions that are of clinically relevant length in some patients. Identification of patients who will benefit from immunotherapy is crucial.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>Renal cell carcinomas account for 2% of all malignant tumours in adults.<xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr"><sup>1</sup></xref> 30% of patients with renal cell carcinoma present with metastatic disease, and half of those who apparently have localised disease at diagnosis subsequently develop metastases.<xref rid="bib2 bib3" ref-type="bibr"><sup>2,3</sup></xref> Median survival for patients with advanced disease is 10 months and 5-year survival is 15%.<xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr"><sup>3</sup></xref> The standard of care in Europe was, until the introduction of targeted agents, interferon alfa-2a, on the basis of results of several randomised trials.<xref rid="bib4 bib5 bib6 bib7 bib8" ref-type="bibr"><sup>4–8</sup></xref> Findings of a Cochrane systematic review and meta-analysis<xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr"><sup>7</sup></xref> confirmed the superiority of interferon alfa-2a compared with medroxyprogesterone acetate or vinblastine. Case-control data and the results of the French Intergroup PERCY Quattro trial<xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr"><sup>9</sup></xref> have suggested that this benefit is confined to patients with good prognostic features—ie, only 20% of patients with metastatic disease.<xref rid="bib10 bib11 bib12" ref-type="bibr"><sup>10–12</sup></xref></p>
      <p>Treatment with high-dose interleukin-2 has shown response rates of 14–23%,<xref rid="bib13 bib14 bib15" ref-type="bibr"><sup>13–15</sup></xref> but, more importantly, about 7% of patients have a durable complete remission lasting longer than 3 years, some of which are maintained for 10 years.<xref rid="bib13 bib14 bib15 bib16 bib17 bib18 bib19" ref-type="bibr"><sup>13–19</sup></xref> However, no randomised trial data have shown a survival advantage for this treatment compared with a control group.<xref rid="bib15 bib16" ref-type="bibr"><sup>15,16</sup></xref> Investigators are attempting to find histopathological and molecular predictive markers that would allow improved selection of patients for this treatment (registered at <ext-link xlink:href="http://Clinicaltrials.gov" ext-link-type="uri">Clinicaltrials.gov</ext-link>, <ext-link xlink:href="ctgov:NCT00536757" ext-link-type="uri">NCT00536757</ext-link>).</p>
      <p>The immunotherapy regimen that has been associated with the highest response rates in metastatic renal cell carcinoma is a combination of interferon alfa-2a, interleukin-2, and fluorouracil.<xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr"><sup>20</sup></xref> Response rates as high as 39% have been reported,<xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr"><sup>20</sup></xref> and results of two small randomised trials<xref rid="bib20 bib21" ref-type="bibr"><sup>20,21</sup></xref> have shown an overall survival advantage compared with tamoxifen and interferon alfa-2a plus vinblastine. However, this regimen is controversial since not all groups have been able to reproduce these high response rates. The UK Medical Research Council (MRC) and the European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) therefore decided to mount a large-scale randomised trial comparing the then standard of care in Europe—namely, interferon alfa-2a alone—with combined interferon alfa-2a, interleukin-2, and fluorouracil, with Atzpodien and colleagues' original schedule.<xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr"><sup>20</sup></xref> The primary objective of the trial was to compare overall survival between groups.</p>

        <title>Participants</title>
        <p>RE04/30012 was an intergroup study for which the MRC Clinical Trials Unit was the coordinating group. The EORTC Genitourinary Group participated via a mailbox procedure with case report forms sent from EORTC sites to the MRC Clinical Trials Unit via the EORTC Headquarters. Patients were eligible for trial entry if they were aged older than 18 years, had histologically proven renal cell carcinoma, advanced metastatic disease, at least one measurable lesion (measured within 4 weeks of starting treatment), a WHO performance status of 0 or 1, normal haematological measures within 7 days before randomisation, creatinine concentrations within normal limits for the participating institution, and a life expectancy of longer than 12 weeks. Patients were excluded if they had received previous chemotherapy, endocrine therapy with biological agents, or radiotherapy to target lesions, had brain metastasis, unstable angina pectoris, or myocardial infarction within the previous 6 months, had evidence of active infection needing antibiotics, had received a major organ allograft, or needed corticosteroids for intercurrent disease. Patients with previous malignant disease could be included if they had been disease free for longer than 5 years. We recommended that patients underwent resection of their primary tumour before entry, but this procedure was not mandatory. Written informed consent was obtained before randomisation. Ethics approval was obtained for RE04 through the London multicentre regional ethics committee (January, 2001) and via local sites for 30012. An independent data monitoring committee reviewed safety data at regular intervals.</p>
      </sec>
      <sec>
        <title>Randomisation and masking</title>
        <p>Randomisation was done by telephone through the MRC Clinical Trials Unit (London, UK) or the EORTC Headquarters (Brussels, Belgium). Randomisation used a method of minimisation to allocate patients in a 1 to 1 ratio. Minimisation factors were centre, nephrectomy status, and whether metastases were at one or several sites. Treatment allocation was not masked.</p>
      </sec>
      <sec sec-type="methods">
        <title>Procedures</title>
        <p>Written informed consent and baseline data were obtained before randomisation, including quality of life (Rotterdam Symptom Checklist, the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale, and the EuroQol Five Dimensions questionnaire). Tumour response was assessed with Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumours criteria at weeks 9, 19, and 26 (irrespective of whether protocol treatment was still being received) and at the end of protocol treatment. Patients were clinically assessed at 8, 10, and 12 months after randomisation, every 4 months in the second year, and every 6 months thereafter. Toxic effects were assessed with National Cancer Institute Common Toxicity Criteria on day 5 of weeks 1, 4, 7, 9, 11, 14, 17, and 19 during treatment. Quality of life assessments were done at baseline, 9, 19, and 26 weeks.</p>
        <p>Patients allocated to treatment with interferon alfa-2a were given the drug subcutaneously three times a week (at MRC centres, Intron A [Schering Corporation, Kenilworth, NJ, USA], 10 million IU; EORTC, Roferon [F Hoffmann-La Roche, Basel, Switzerland], 9 million IU). Patients assigned to combination treatment received interferon alfa-2a, interleukin-2, and fluorouracil (schedule provided in <xref rid="sec1" ref-type="sec">webappendix</xref>). Patients receiving interferon alfa-2a alone were treated until progression or unacceptable toxic effects, according to investigator discretion. Patients allocated to combination treatment received a second cycle if at week 9 no unacceptable toxic effects or signs of progression were reported. No more than two cycles were recommended. The primary outcome was overall survival. Secondary outcomes were progression-free survival and comparisons of toxic effects, quality of life, and response to treatment.</p>
      </sec>
      <sec>
        <title>Statistical analysis</title>
        <p>The original sample size needed 510 events (deaths) from 670 patients to detect a 4-month (12–16 months) improvement in median survival with combination treatment, sufficient to detect a hazard ratio (HR) of 0·75 at a 5% significance level and 90% power. In 2005, independently of the then current confidential results, the sample size was revised to detect a reduced target treatment effect and to allow subset analyses of histology and nephrectomy status. The revised target was 845 events (1100 patients), which was sufficient to detect an improvement in median survival from 12 to 15 months (HR 0·8 at a 5% significance level and 90% power). The revision was made because combination treatment was less toxic than was originally expected and thus a smaller treatment difference would be worthwhile.</p>
        <p>We used Stata (version 10.1) for all statistical analyses. Overall survival was defined as time from randomisation to death from any cause; data for patients who were alive at last follow-up were censored at date of last contact. Progression-free survival was defined as time from randomisation to date of first progression or death from any cause. Non-stratified log-rank tests were used to compare treatment groups. Cox models for treatment effect on overall and progression-free survival were adjusted for WHO performance status, haemoglobin concentrations, and white blood cell counts, and transformed time from diagnosis of metastases to randomisation (inverse square root). These measures were chosen because they were significant prognostic factors in the results of the MRC RE01 study.<xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr"><sup>8</sup></xref> We used the Stata program stpm<xref rid="bib22" ref-type="bibr"><sup>22</sup></xref> to apply a flexible parametric modelling approach that allowed for non-proportional hazards of the treatment effect.<xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr"><sup>23</sup></xref> The model was used to estimate absolute differences in survival between treatment groups with time. All analyses were done on an intention-to-treat basis and all p values are two-sided.</p>
        <p>To assess whether any treatment is more or less effective dependent on binary baseline variables, we did a χ<sup>2</sup> test for heterogeneity. Interactions between treatment and continuous variables were examined with fractional polynomial models.<xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr"><sup>24</sup></xref> The effect of treatment according to centre size was investigated with an interaction test for trend. Best response to treatment was compared between treatment groups with a χ<sup>2</sup> test. Responders were defined as patients with complete or part responses and non-responders as those with stable disease or progression. Duration of response was defined as time from first reported response until disease progression or death.</p>
        <p>Worst toxic effects reported overall were compared between treatment groups with a Mann-Whitney test. Binary variables (grade 0, 1, or 2 <italic>vs</italic> grade 3 or 4) were created for all reports of toxic effects and Fisher's exact tests were applied to compare treatment groups. Hypotheses were formulated and stated in the statistical analysis plan for four patient-reported quality-of-life items (tiredness, poor appetite, low energy, and shivering) before the start of the trial. Worst score overall was used so that treatment groups were of similar size (interferon alfa-2a alone, n=444; combined treatment, n=454). We used Mann-Whitney tests to assess these hypotheses by comparing worst scores by treatment group.</p>
        <p>All patients were grouped retrospectively according to the widely used Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Centre criteria (MSKCC).<xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr"><sup>12</sup></xref> MSKCC risk groups are approximations for our data because groupings are based on thresholds that were defined by Motzer and colleagues,<xref rid="bib25" ref-type="bibr"><sup>25</sup></xref> but laboratory normal ranges for concentrations of lactate dehydrogenase and haemoglobin were not obtained at randomisation and some blood measurements were missing.</p>

      <title>Results</title>
      <p>The trial opened to accrual in April, 2001, and closed in August, 2006. 1006 patients were randomly allocated to treatment (707 MRC, 299 EORTC) from 50 centres across the UK, Holland, Slovakia, Germany, Belgium, and Denmark. 502 patients were allocated to receive interferon alfa-2a and 504 to receive combined treatment (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">figure 1</xref>). <xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref> shows patients' characteristics. We note that a high proportion of patients had undergone nephrectomy before study entry.</p>
      <p>Median duration of treatment for patients receiving interferon alfa-2a was 127 days (range 3–1803). 118 (24%) patients received the drug for 3–6 months, 114 (23%) for 6–12 months, and 47 (10%) for longer than 12 months. 138 (29%) patients receiving interferon alfa-2a alone had a dose modification, and 102 (21%) had a break in treatment (<xref rid="sec1" ref-type="sec">webappendix</xref>). However, only 56 (12%) patients received less than 60% of the target dose. The most common causes of dose modification in patients receiving interferon alfa-2a were lethargy or depression (63 patients, 13%), nausea or haematological toxic effects (eight and ten patients, both 2%), and neurotoxic effects (seven patients, 1%). 50 (10%) patients had dose modifications for other or several reasons.</p>
      <p>For patients receiving combined treatment, median duration of a treatment cycle was 54 days (range 2–138) and median duration of trial treatment was 57 days (2–222). 486 (96%) patients started cycle one, 192 (38%) started cycle two, three (1%) went on to receive a third cycle, and one (&lt;1%) a fourth cycle. In cycle one, 140 (29%) patients had a dose modification for interferon alfa-2a, 118 (24%) for interleukin-2, and 105 (22%) for fluorouracil; in cycle two, these values were 64 (33%), 66 (34%), and 59 (31%), respectively. Haematological toxic effects, lethargy or depression, and other or several reasons were the most common causes of dose modification in patients receiving combined treatment. 221 (45%) patients had a break in treatment during cycle 1 and 71 (37%) in cycle two (<xref rid="sec1" ref-type="sec">webappendix</xref>). For cycle 1, 278 (57%), 312 (64%), and 253 (52%) patients received 80% or more of their expected dose for interferon alfa-2a, interleukin-2, and fluorouracil, respectively.</p>
      <p>Analysis was done at a median follow-up of 37·2 months (24·8–52·3) and when 691 participants had died (340 patients receiving interferon alfa-2a, 351 receiving combined treatment). The data were locked for analysis on Sept 12, 2008. <xref rid="tbl2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>, <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">figure 2</xref>, and <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">figure 3</xref> show a summary of results. We noted no evidence of a difference between treatment groups for overall survival (HR 1·05 [95% CI 0·90–1·21]; p=0·55). Overall survival at 1 year was 67% (62–71) for patients receiving interferon alfa-2a and 67% (63–71) for combined treatment. At 3 years, overall survival was 30% (26–35) in the interferon alfa-2a group and 26% (22–30) in the combined group. Absolute difference in overall survival between groups was 0·3% (−5·1 to 5·6) at 1 year and 2·7% (−8·2 to 2·9) at 3 years. Median survival of patients given interferon alfa-2a alone was 18·8 months (17·0–23·2) versus 18·6 months (16·5–20·6) for those in the combined group.</p>
      <p>At the time of analysis, 921 participants had progression of disease or had died (interferon alfa-2a, 464; combined treatment, 457). There was no evidence that progression-free survival differed between treatment groups (HR 1·02 [0·89–1·16]; p=0·81). Median progression-free survival in patients receiving interferon alfa-2a alone was 5·5 months (4·3–6·2) compared with 5·3 months (4·8–6·0) in those on combined treatment. The robustness of the results was examined with Cox models adjusted for prognostic factors that were shown to be significant by results of the MRC RE01 study. Adjusted and unadjusted models showed similar results (overall survival, adjusted HR 1·12 [0·96–1·30], p=0·14; progression-free survival, 1·03 [0·90–1·17], p=0·69).</p>
      <p>The best overall response rate in patients receiving combined treatment was significantly higher than in patients receiving interferon alfa-2a alone (108 of 462 patients [23%] <italic>vs</italic> 73 of 458 [16%]; p=0·0045). Complete response to treatment was recorded in 11 patients receiving interferon alfa-2a (median duration 15·6 months, IQR 5·3–not reached) and 11 on combined treatment (median duration not reached). One patient with a complete response who was allocated to combined treatment did not receive all three drugs, but rather interferon alfa-2a alone because of a mistake by the treatment centre. Complete remissions were durable in four patients who received only interferon alfa-2a (&gt;14, &gt;26, &gt;44, and &gt;55 months) and in eight patients who received combined therapy (&gt;9, &gt;12, &gt;48, &gt;53, &gt;54, &gt;59, &gt;65, and &gt;78 months).</p>
      <p>Exploratory analyses to examine interactions between treatment and baseline factors showed no evidence of interactions for overall survival. Outcomes for patients receiving complex immunotherapies might be better when delivered by large specialist centres. Therefore, patients were classified according to the number randomised by a centre: fewer than nine, ten to 20, or greater than 20 patients. The effect of combined treatment was not related to centre (data not shown).</p>
      <p>Survival of patients by MSKCC prognostic category compared favourably with published data (<xref rid="tbl3" ref-type="table">table 3</xref>). A prognostic model was developed from RE01, our previous trial in metastatic renal cell carcinoma, which compared treatment with interferon alfa-2a alone with treatment with medroxyprogesterone acetate. The model took into account WHO performance status, haemoglobin, white blood cell count, and time from diagnosis of metastatic disease to randomisation. Three prognostic categories were defined (good, intermediate, and poor), and median survival of patients in RE04/30012 was better than for those in RE01 for all prognostic groups (good, 37·3 <italic>vs</italic> 15·5 months; intermediate, 19·3 <italic>vs</italic> 9·0 months, and poor, 8·0 <italic>vs</italic> 2·2 months). The explanation is uncertain, although this finding might be an example of how survival from cancer can improve with advances in supportive care.</p>
      <p>Post-protocol antitumour treatment data were obtained and seven (1%) patients receiving interferon alfa-2a alone crossed over to the triple regimen and 53 (11%) on combined treatment were subsequently given single-agent interferon alfa-2a. For interferon alfa-2a alone, 25 patients received medroxyprogesterone acetate, 106 underwent radiotherapy, 25 had surgery, and 242 received other post-progression treatment, compared with 31, 121, 23, and 233 patients, respectively, in the combined group. Of patients who received other post-progression treatment, 281 (28%) received a targeted agent (151 [30%] receiving interferon alfa-2a and 130 [26%] on combined treatment).</p>
      <p><xref rid="tbl4" ref-type="table">Table 4</xref> and <xref rid="tbl5" ref-type="table">table 5</xref> show results for toxic effects of treatment. During treatment significantly more grade 3 and 4 toxic effects were associated with combined treatment than with interferon alfa-2a alone (269 patients [53%] <italic>vs</italic> 183 patients [36%]; p&lt;0·0001). Fatigue was appreciably worse for patients receiving combined treatment, with 106 (22%) of 479 patients reporting grade 1 fatigue, 214 (45%) grade 2, 113 (23%) grade 3, and nine (2%) grade 4, compared with 161 (34%), 186 (39%), 83 (17%), and two (&lt;1%) for those receiving interferon alfa-2a. We noted no evidence for differences between treatment groups in worst quality of life score for tiredness, poor appetite, shivering, or low energy. Serious adverse events were reported in 113 (23%) patients receiving interferon alfa-2a and 131 (26%) of those receiving combined treatment.</p>

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>The results of our large trial clearly show that combined treatment with interferon alfa-2a, interleukin-2, and fluorouracil provides no advantage compared with interferon alfa-2a alone in terms of overall or progression-free survival. However, the overall response rate was higher in patients receiving combined treatment than in those receiving interferon alfa-2a alone, although the response rate for combined treatment was 23%, which is not nearly as high as the 39% reported by Atzpodien and colleagues.<xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr"><sup>20</sup></xref> Treatment was well tolerated and toxic effects were manageable. Combined treatment was associated with more severe toxic effects overall than was treatment with interferon alfa-2a alone. The median duration of treatment with interferon alfa-2a for patients in our study (4·2 months) was similar to those reported for the interferon alfa-2a control groups of other first-line studies.<xref rid="bib26 bib27" ref-type="bibr"><sup>26,27</sup></xref></p>
      <p>Dose modifications and breaks occurred with both regimens, but breaks were more frequent for patients receiving combined therapy than for those receiving interferon alfa-2a. Three-quarters of patients given interferon alfa-2a alone received 80% or more of their expected dose. Reductions were more common for those receiving combined treatment. The high degree of dose reduction with combined therapy could be a reason for the absence of benefit for this regimen. However, we believe that this finding is representative of the feasibility of this treatment, and no difference existed between the treatments according to size or experience of the treating centre. Atzpodien and colleagues<xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr"><sup>20</sup></xref> reported that 23% of patients went on to a third cycle of combined therapy. Our decision to limit the total number of cycles to two was made after wide consultation with physicians at major cancer centres in which cytokine therapies are used, including combined interferon alfa-2a, interleukin-2, and fluorouracil, for metastatic renal cell carcinoma. Despite this consultation, our study could be criticised for not administering combined therapy for an adequate number of cycles.</p>
      <p>We obtained post-progression treatment information, which was reasonably balanced between the two treatment groups. The survival of patients with low risk prognostic factors in RE04/30012 was similar to the MSKCC prognostic model dataset (median survival 32·8 months for RE04/30012 and 29·6 months for MSKCC). Patients with medium and high risk prognostic categories in RE04/30012 had a better outlook than was suggested by the prognostic model (<xref rid="tbl3" ref-type="table">table 3</xref>). This finding could be because none of the RE04/30012 patients had all five risk factors, since WHO performance status of greater than 1 was an exclusion criterion.</p>
      <p>The predefined number of events was not reached; however, with 691 events at the time of analysis our conclusions have been made on the basis of a large amount of information. The Kaplan-Meier plots show no long-term treatment effect, and no discernible biological reason exists for why a difference between treatment groups might occur only after more events have accrued. Publication of these results in a timely manner was important.</p>
      <p>Targeted agents have become standard of care for first-line treatment of patients with metastatic renal cell carcinoma, on the basis of results of three randomised trials,<xref rid="bib26 bib27 bib28" ref-type="bibr"><sup>26–28</sup></xref> all of which used interferon alfa-2a alone as control. Two of these trials have shown large benefits for targeted therapies compared with single-agent interferon alfa-2a, with HRs for progression-free survival of 0·42–0·63.<xref rid="bib26 bib27" ref-type="bibr"><sup>26,27</sup></xref> Overall survival could also be significantly improved by these novel agents; patients who received temsirolimus alone in a first-line study with three groups had longer overall survival than did those receiving interferon alfa-2a alone (HR 0·73; p=0·008), and sunitinib has an overall survival advantage compared with interferon alfa-2a (p=0·051).<xref rid="bib29 bib30" ref-type="bibr"><sup>29,30</sup></xref> Our results are important because they show that single-agent interferon was the correct control treatment to use in these pivotal trials that have defined the role of targeted agents. If we had shown combined treatment to be better than monotherapy, then these trials would have had to be re-run with combined interferon alfa-2a, interleukin-2, and fluorouracil as control treatment.</p>
      <p>None of the novel targeted agents seem to be curative, and immunotherapy remains the only curative treatment available for patients with metastatic renal cell carcinoma, albeit in a very few patients. We noted complete remissions in both treatment groups, which were durable in 12 patients. This finding is of clinical relevance because high-dose intravenous interleukin-2 is often stated to be the only therapy that is associated with durable complete remissions in metastatic disease. Our data show that this drug is not the only one to be associated with complete remission, although we report a reduced rate of complete remission with the treatments given in our trial. A subgroup of patients might exist who could benefit from starting therapy with an immunotherapeutic drug rather than a targeted agent.</p>
