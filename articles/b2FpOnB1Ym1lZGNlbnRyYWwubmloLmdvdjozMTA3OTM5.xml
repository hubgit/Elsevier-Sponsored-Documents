      <abstract>
        <p>Alpha-synuclein aggregation plays a central role in Parkinson's disease pathology. Direct transmission of alpha-synuclein from pathologically affected to healthy unaffected neurons may be important in the anatomical spread of the disease through the nervous system. We have demonstrated that exosomes released from alpha-synuclein over-expressing SH-SY5Y cells contained alpha-synuclein and these exosomes were capable of efficiently transferring alpha-synuclein protein to normal SH-SY5Y cells. Moreover, the incubation of cells with ammonium chloride or bafilomycin A1 to produce the lysosomal dysfunction recently reported in Parkinson's disease led to an increase in the release of alpha-synuclein in exosomes and a concomitant increase in alpha-synuclein transmission to recipient cells. This study clearly demonstrates the importance of exosomes in both the release of alpha synuclein and its transmission between cells and suggests that factors associated with PD pathology accelerate this process. These mechanisms may play an important role in PD pathology and provide a suitable target for therapeutic intervention.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>Parkinson's disease (PD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder characterised pathologically by the loss of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra pars compacta and the presence of Lewy bodies (LB) which are intra-cytoplasmic inclusions containing high levels of alpha-synuclein (<xref rid="bb0110" ref-type="bibr">Spillantini et al., 1997</xref>). The discovery of mutations (A53T, A30P, E46K) and multiplications of the alpha-synuclein gene in familial forms of PD further demonstrate the importance of alpha-synuclein to PD pathology (<xref rid="bb0070" ref-type="bibr">Lee and Trojanowski 2006</xref>). Host-to-graft propagation of alpha-synuclein-positive Lewy-like pathology has recently been demonstrated in long-term mesencephalic transplants in PD patients (<xref rid="bb0075 bb0060" ref-type="bibr">Li et al., 2008; Kordower et al. 2008</xref>). <italic>In vitro</italic> experiments co-culturing over-expressing cells with non-expressing and neuronal precursor cells also showed cell-to-cell transmission of alpha-synuclein (<xref rid="bb0040" ref-type="bibr">Desplats et al., 2009</xref>). These studies support the notion that alpha-synuclein can be directly transmitted from pathologically affected to healthy unaffected neurons leading to progression of the disease process through the nervous system. This could be an explanation of the step-wise progression of the disease pathology and the involvement of anatomically distinct pathways. Recently, a study described the secretion of alpha-synuclein in association with membrane vesicles of composition and biophysical properties consistent with their identification as exosomes (<xref rid="bb0050" ref-type="bibr">Emmanoulidou et al., 2010</xref>).</p>
      <p>Exosomes are membrane-bound vesicles of endocytic origin released by numerous cell types and found in abundance in body fluids (<xref rid="bb0105" ref-type="bibr">Simpson et al., 2008</xref>) where they act as natural carriers of mRNA, miRNA and proteins (<xref rid="bb0100" ref-type="bibr">Schorey and Bhatnagar 2008</xref>). Exosomes have been associated with prion protein release from cultured non-neuronal and neuronal cells (<xref rid="bb0055" ref-type="bibr">Fevrier et al., 2004</xref>; <xref rid="bb0120" ref-type="bibr">Vella et al., 2007</xref>); moreover, exosomes released from prion-infected neuronal cells were efficient initiators of prion propagation in uninfected recipient cells.</p>
      <p>We examined exosomes released from SH-SY5Y cells stably over-expressing WT alpha-synuclein to determine if they contained alpha-synuclein protein and whether exosomes can mediate alpha-synuclein transfer between neuronal cells. The inter-cellular transfer of alpha-synuclein may not in itself be sufficient to propagate PD pathology and other factors may play a role. Given the observation that lysosomal function is essential for alpha-synuclein metabolism and the evidence of lysosomal dysfunction in PD brains (<xref rid="bb0005" ref-type="bibr">Alvarez-Erviti et al., 2010</xref>) we assessed whether lysosomal dysfunction could influence alpha-synuclein release and transmission.</p>

The system focuses a laser beam through a suspension of the particles of interest. These are visualised by light scattering, using a conventional optical microscope aligned normally to the beam axis which collects light scattered from every particle in the field of view. A 20–60 second video records all events for further analysis by NTA (Nanoparticle Tracking Analysis) software. The Brownian motion of each particle is tracked between frames, ultimately allowing calculation of the size via application of the Stokes–Einstein equation.</p>

        <title>Exosomes released by SH-SY5Y cells contained and transferred alpha-synuclein</title>
        <p>Exosomes were isolated from normal and WT alpha-synuclein over-expressing SH-SY5Y conditioned medium (CM) using an established ultracentrifugation protocol (<xref rid="bb0095" ref-type="bibr">Quah and O'Neill 2005</xref>). Exosomes obtained from the ultracentrifuge pellets were examined by electronic microscopy and by NTA. Both techniques demonstrated that a homogenous population of exosomal vesicles with a size distribution peaking at a diameter of 93 and 99 nm for normal and alpha-synuclein expressing cells respectively (<xref rid="f0005" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>a and b) could be readily isolated and identified. Western blot analysis confirmed the presence of the exosomal proteins, LAMP-1, flotillin-1 and Alix (<xref rid="bb0105" ref-type="bibr">Simpson et al., 2008</xref>) in exosome preparations from both sets of cells. However, alpha-synuclein protein was detectable only in exosomes from cells over-expressing alpha-synuclein-HA (<xref rid="f0005" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>c). This finding was consistent with the undetectable levels of endogenous alpha-synuclein protein in normal SH-SY5Y cells (data not shown). Antibodies against flotillin-1 were used to immunoprecipitate exosomes from CM from alpha-synuclein over-expressing cells. The immunoprecipitate was positive for LAMP-1 and alpha-synuclein and the flow through medium was negative for both proteins (<xref rid="f0005" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>d). Quantitation of alpha-synuclein levels in conditioned medium and flow through using ELISA analysis (<xref rid="f0005" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>e) confirmed the majority of the alpha-synuclein was associated with the exosomes.</p>
        <p>To investigate whether alpha-synuclein could be transmitted from one cell to another via exosomes we isolated exosomes from CM from normal and alpha-synuclein over-expressing SH-SY5Y cells and incubated them with normal SH-SY5Y cells for 16 h. Only the SH-SY5Y cells incubated with exosomes isolated from alpha-synuclein expressing cells showed the presence of detectable alpha-synuclein on Western blot (<xref rid="f0010" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>a) and immunocytochemical analyses (<xref rid="f0010" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>b and c).This was detected with both anti-alpha-synuclein and anti-HA antibodies confirming the transmission from the donor cells (<xref rid="f0010" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>b) and confocal analysis confirmed its intracellular location (<xref rid="f0010" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>c). Disruption of exosomes by sonication (<xref rid="bb0115" ref-type="bibr">Stoeckl et al., 2006</xref>) prior to their incubation with recipient cells prevented the transfer of alpha-synuclein (<xref rid="f0010" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>d), indicating efficient transfer of alpha-synuclein to recipient cells required intact exosomes. This transfer was not unique to dividing cells as we were also able to confirm the exosomal dependent transfer of alpha-synuclein to differentiated SH-SY5Y cells (<xref rid="f0010" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>e).</p>

        <title>Influence of lysosomal inhibition upon alpha-synuclein levels</title>
        <p>Alpha-synuclein protein is degraded predominantly through lysosomal pathways therefore requiring intact lysosomal function (<xref rid="bb0085" ref-type="bibr">Paxinou et al., 2001</xref>). In an attempt to mimic the abnormal lysosomal function described in PD (<xref rid="bb0005" ref-type="bibr">Alvarez-Erviti et al., 2010</xref>) we inhibited lysosomal function in normal and WT alpha-synuclein over-expressing SH-SY5Y cells with ammonium chloride for 7 days or with the vacuolar H + ATPase inhibitor bafilomycin A1 for 24 and 72 h (<xref rid="bb0080" ref-type="bibr">Martinez-Vicente et al., 2008</xref>). There were no adverse effects on cell survival with the exception of prolonged bafilomycin treatment which caused marked cell loss (<xref rid="f0015" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>a). The level of the autophagosomal marker LC3-II was increased with these treatments consistent with decreased degradation of autophagic vacuoles associated with lysosomal dysfunction (<xref rid="f0015" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>b and c). Relative to untreated cells alpha-synuclein levels (corrected to actin levels) increased significantly following ammonium chloride (increased 79.6% ± 6.3) and bafilomycin (increased 71.3% ± 3.8 after 24 h, 107.5% ± 11.2 after 72 h) treatment in over-expressing cells (<xref rid="f0015" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>b–d) but remained undetectable in normal cells (data not shown). The impact of these treatments upon aggregate formation was investigated using the differential solubility of alpha-synuclein. Cells were sequentially extracted in high salt, 1% triton and SDS/urea and the relative levels of alpha-synuclein assessed in each fraction. While the majority of alpha-synuclein was extracted in high salt medium in all conditions there was clearly evidence of a triton insoluble pool of alpha-synuclein following both ammonium chloride and bafilomycin treatments that was not seen in the controls (<xref rid="f0015" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>e). This suggested that lysosomal dysfunction led to evidence of insoluble alpha-synuclein consistent with the presence of aggregates; however, while the immunocytochemical images were consistent with alpha-synuclein accumulation there was no clear evidence of aggregates.</p>

        <p>Lysosomal dysfunction caused a dramatic increase in total alpha-synuclein release into the cell medium (increased 300–620% at all time points assessed, <xref rid="f0020" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref>a). The isolation of exosomes from the conditioned medium demonstrated this marked increase in alpha-synuclein levels was also apparent in the exosomes after exposure to ammonium chloride for 7 days (435% ± 29.8) or bafilomycin A1 for 24 h (397.5% ± 18.2) or 72 h (451.9% ± 21.6) (<xref rid="f0020" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref>b and c).</p>
        <p>Following incubation of the exosomes released from alpha-synuclein over-expressing cells inhibited by ammonium chloride with normal SH-SY5Y cells, the level of alpha-synuclein present in the recipient cells was markedly increased compared with that seen in experiments performed without lysosomal inhibition (increased 307.1 ± 34.1 %, <xref rid="f0020" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref>d and e). This was also evident upon immunofluorescent analysis with an increase in both the intensity of alpha-synuclein staining (<xref rid="f0020" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref>f) and number of recipient cells containing detectable levels of alpha-synuclein (96% and 38% of recipients cells after incubation with exosomes from ammonium chloride treated and untreated cells, respectively). Confocal microscopy analysis confirmed the presence of alpha-synuclein throughout the cell consistent with an intracellular location (<xref rid="f0020" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref>g). Moreover, the presence of alpha-synuclein positive inclusions (seen in 0.2% of cells after incubation with exosomes from untreated cells) was also more apparent in cells incubated with exosomes from ammonium chloride treated cells (seen in 3.6% of cells) (<xref rid="f0020" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref>f, panels iii and iv). These observations were not only restricted to the transfer of alpha-synuclein to mitotic cells as similar results were obtained when exosomes were incubated with differentiated SH-SY5Y cells (<xref rid="f0020" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref>f, panel v).</p>

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>While there is clear evidence that alpha-synuclein plays an important role in PD pathology, its exact role in pathogenesis remains unclear. Alpha-synuclein is prone to aggregation leading to its presence in LB; however, the debate as to whether soluble protofibrils or aggregates of alpha-synuclein are the pathological entity remains to be resolved. The Braak staging of PD pathology suggests that there is a progression of LB pathology from the brainstem to the cortex consistent with pathological propagation along specific neural pathways (<xref rid="bb0020" ref-type="bibr">Braak et al., 2003</xref>). The recent finding of Lewy body inclusions in embryonic dopaminergic nerve cells implanted into the striatum of patients with PD (<xref rid="bb0075" ref-type="bibr">Li et al., 2008</xref>; <xref rid="bb0060" ref-type="bibr">Kordower et al., 2008</xref>) has given fresh impetus to the importance of alpha-synuclein propagation in PD pathology.</p>
      <p>While alpha-synuclein is predominantly a cytosolic protein associated with dopamine metabolism, extracellular alpha-synuclein has been observed in CSF and plasma in humans (<xref rid="bb0015" ref-type="bibr">Borghi et al., 2000</xref>; <xref rid="bb0045" ref-type="bibr">El-Agnaf et al., 2003</xref>). The release of alpha-synuclein from cells via exocytosis has been previously reported in SH-SY5Y cells over-expressing human alpha-synuclein (<xref rid="bb0065" ref-type="bibr">Lee et al., 2005</xref>) and associated with membrane vesicles whose identity is compatible with exosomes (<xref rid="bb0050" ref-type="bibr">Emmanoulidou et al., 2010</xref>), and we have confirmed this observation. The possibility of pathological alpha-synuclein propagation between cells was further strengthened when alpha-synuclein was recently shown to be transferred to neighbouring cells, via a process involving endocytosis (<xref rid="bb0040" ref-type="bibr">Desplats et al., 2009</xref>). However to date the precise mechanisms of alpha-synuclein release and uptake by recipient cells remains ill defined.</p>
      <p>Exosomes have been previously associated with pathological prion protein transmission from neuronal and non-neuronal infected cell lines to uninfected recipient cells (<xref rid="bb0055" ref-type="bibr">Fevrier et al., 2004</xref>; <xref rid="bb0010" ref-type="bibr">Alais et al., 2008</xref>). We have demonstrated that alpha-synuclein released from SH-SY5Y cells can be recovered by a centrifugation protocol used to purify exosomes (<xref rid="bb0095" ref-type="bibr">Quah and O'Neill 2005</xref>). While exosomes do not have any unique characteristic feature, a combination of features is accepted as evidence of their identity (<xref rid="bb0105" ref-type="bibr">Simpson et al., 2008</xref>). The characterisation of vesicle preparations in this study revealed an electron microscopic appearance, vesicle size profile and the presence of LAMP-1, flotillin-1 and Alix proteins, all of which are indicative of an exosomal identity. These results are in agreement with observations from cells with inducible expression of alpha-synuclein (<xref rid="bb0050" ref-type="bibr">Emmanoulidou et al., 2010</xref>). We were also able to immunoprecipitate the exosomes from alpha-synuclein over-expressing cells which pulled down the majority of the alpha-synuclein in the medium consistent with the role of exosomes in the extracellular release of alpha-synuclein. The isolated exosomes were capable of transferring alpha-synuclein to naive cells; however, sonicated exosomes were no longer able to efficiently do this outlining the importance of the exosome in this transfer mechanism. This transfer was not restricted to dividing cells as similar data were obtained with differentiated SH-SY5Y recipient cells demonstrating the exosome mediated transfer of alpha-synuclein could be effective in differentiated neurones. Confocal microscopy analysis was consistent with the intracellular localisation of alpha-synuclein within the recipient cells. While not all cells stained positive for the transferred alpha-synuclein, occasional cells showed the presence of large inclusions. These could represent vesicle bound alpha-synuclein or the presence of aggregates but were not abundant enough for definitive analysis.</p>
      <p>While it is apparent that alpha-synuclein is transferred between cells, its relevance to normal physiology or pathology is not clear. Equally, while the transmission of alpha-synuclein could lead to the propagation of this protein throughout the brain, its transfer between cells may not be sufficient in itself to transmit the pathology associated with PD. It is therefore important to demonstrate that this process can be involved in the propagation of aggregated alpha-synuclein in a manner similar to that suggested for prion diseases (<xref rid="bb0055" ref-type="bibr">Fevrier et al., 2004</xref>; <xref rid="bb0010" ref-type="bibr">Alais et al., 2008</xref>). It is possible that the transfer of alpha-synuclein from one cell to the next initiates a cell stress response ultimately leading to alpha-synuclein aggregation and further transmission to neighbouring cells (<xref rid="bb0040" ref-type="bibr">Desplats et al., 2009</xref>). Equally the biochemical abnormalities found in PD brains could exacerbate the propagation of a pathological form of alpha-synuclein which, when transferred to neighbouring cells, acts to ‘seed’ aggregate formation.</p>
      <p>In an attempt to model the generation of an aggregate prone form of alpha-synuclein we investigated the effect of lysosomal inhibition. Lysosomal function has been reported to be decreased in PD patients (<xref rid="bb0030" ref-type="bibr">Chu et al., 2009</xref>; <xref rid="bb0005" ref-type="bibr">Alvarez-Erviti et al., 2010</xref>) and alpha-synuclein is known to require the lysosome for its degradation (<xref rid="bb0085" ref-type="bibr">Paxinou et al., 2001</xref>). In an attempt to mimic a defect of intracellular protein handling in PD we inhibited lysosomal function in the exosome donor cells using ammonium chloride or bafilomycin A1. Lysosomal inhibition by ammonium chloride for 3 and 7 days and bafilomycin for 24 h and 72 h all dramatically increased alpha-synuclein release from the SH-SY5Y cells. However, this was only associated with significant cell death in cells treated with bafilomycin for 72 h consistent with exosome mediated alpha-synuclein release and not a consequence of cell death. While lysosomal inhibition increased the cellular content of alpha-synuclein, we were unable to detect any clear evidence of intra-cellular protein aggregates; however, there was an increase in triton insoluble alpha-synuclein suggesting the presence of aggregates. The increase in cellular alpha-synuclein levels was associated with a dramatic increase in exosomal alpha-synuclein release which led to greater transmission of alpha-synuclein to recipient cells and a greater number of cells containing alpha-synuclein inclusions. These data suggest that the increased exosomal release of alpha-synuclein may be influenced by the increase in intracellular alpha-synuclein consistent with the suggestion that in neurons exosomes may play a direct role in the removal of unwanted proteins (<xref rid="bb0090" ref-type="bibr">Putz et al., 2008</xref>).</p>
      <p>We hypothesise that changes to lysosomal function in PD can accelerate exosomal alpha-synuclein release and propagation to neighbouring cells and a concomitant increase in alpha-synuclein inclusion formation. We believe that this cellular model is a useful approach to test whether other biochemical changes observed in PD can lead to the generation of pathological forms of alpha-synuclein in donor cells that can be propagated via exosomes to other cells and play a role in PD pathogenesis.</p>
