        <title>Summary</title>
        <p>Specific stimuli such as intracellular H<sup>+</sup> and phosphoinositides (e.g., PIP<sub>2</sub>) gate inwardly rectifying potassium (Kir) channels by controlling the reversible transition between the closed and open states. This gating mechanism underlies many aspects of Kir channel physiology and pathophysiology; however, its structural basis is not well understood. Here, we demonstrate that H<sup>+</sup> and PIP<sub>2</sub> use a conserved gating mechanism defined by similar structural changes in the transmembrane (TM) helices and the selectivity filter. Our data support a model in which the gating motion of the TM helices is controlled by an intrasubunit hydrogen bond between TM1 and TM2 at the helix-bundle crossing, and we show that this defines a common gating motif in the Kir channel superfamily. Furthermore, we show that this proposed H-bonding interaction determines Kir channel pH sensitivity, pH and PIP<sub>2</sub> gating kinetics, as well as a K<sup>+</sup>-dependent inactivation process at the selectivity filter and therefore many of the key regulatory mechanisms of Kir channel physiology.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>Inwardly rectifying K<sup>+</sup> (Kir) channels play a vital role in many diverse physiological processes, including control of the heart rate, setting the activation threshold of neuronal excitability, hormonal secretion, extracellular K<sup>+</sup> buffering in the brain, and K<sup>+</sup> secretion in the kidney. These processes are regulated by specific stimuli which cause Kir channels to undergo a reversible transition between the closed and open state. This is known as gating, and examples of stimuli include intracellular H<sup>+</sup>, which induces pore closure in some Kir channels (pH gating) (<xref rid="bib42" ref-type="bibr">Schulte and Fakler, 2000</xref>), and phosphatidylinositol-(4,5)-bisphosphate (PIP<sub>2</sub>), which induces pore opening in all known eukaryotic Kir channels (PIP<sub>2</sub> gating) (<xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">Bichet et al., 2003</xref>).</p>
      <p>The regulation of Kir channels by intracellular H<sup>+</sup> and PIP<sub>2</sub> underlies many important aspects of Kir physiology as well as pathophysiology (<xref rid="bib12 bib16 bib25 bib28" ref-type="bibr">Donaldson et al., 2003, Hebert, 2003; Lin et al., 2006; Lopes et al., 2002</xref>). The mechanism of pH gating has been most widely studied in the Kir1.1 (ROMK) channel, which is found in the apical membrane of renal tubular epithelia where it secretes excess K<sup>+</sup> into the urine. This K<sup>+</sup> transport pathway is regulated by intracellular pH (pH gating) as well as by the luminal K<sup>+</sup> concentration (K<sup>+</sup>-dependent inactivation), and both regulatory mechanisms are essential for the renal control of K<sup>+</sup> homeostasis. This is highlighted by the fact that inherited mutations in Kir1.1 which interfere with this pH-sensing mechanism result in type II Bartter's syndrome, a hypokalaemic disorder (<xref rid="bib16 bib17 bib42" ref-type="bibr">Hebert, 2003; Hebert et al., 2005; Schulte and Fakler, 2000</xref>). Furthermore, the pH sensitivity of Kir1.1, and other pH-sensitive Kir channels such as Kir4.1 and heteromeric Kir4.1/Kir5.1, is thought to be important for the chemosensitivity (CO<sub>2</sub> response) of specific neuronal populations in the brainstem (<xref rid="bib49" ref-type="bibr">Su et al., 2006</xref>) and in the buffering of extracellular K<sup>+</sup> concentrations by glial cells in the brain (<xref rid="bib32" ref-type="bibr">Neusch et al., 2006</xref>).</p>
      <p>The physiological significance of PIP<sub>2</sub> regulation has been demonstrated in studies showing that dynamic changes in phosphoinositide metabolism directly modulate many Kir channels (<xref rid="bib2 bib7 bib21" ref-type="bibr">Baukrowitz and Fakler, 2000; Cho et al., 2005; Kobrinsky et al., 2000</xref>) and that mutations which impair PIP<sub>2</sub> activation cause a variety of channelopathies including Bartter's syndrome, Andersen's syndrome, and congenital hyperinsulinaemia (<xref rid="bib12 bib25 bib28" ref-type="bibr">Donaldson et al., 2003; Lin et al., 2006; Lopes et al., 2002</xref>).</p>
      <p>Most Kir channels are inhibited by intracellular acidosis; however, their pH sensitivity differs markedly. A key determinant of pH sensitivity is a lysine residue in the first transmembrane domain (TM1) at the helix-bundle crossing. Kir channels with a lysine at this position (Kir1.1, Kir4.1, Kir4.2, and Kir4.1/Kir5.1) show high pH sensitivity. By contrast, channels lacking a lysine at this position (e.g., Kir2.1, Kir3.x, and Kir6.2) are markedly less pH sensitive but can increase their pH sensitivity if a lysine is introduced. Originally, it was thought that this lysine was the pH sensor (<xref rid="bib15 bib42 bib43" ref-type="bibr">Fakler et al., 1996; Schulte and Fakler, 2000; Schulte et al., 1999</xref>). However, recent work has shown that this lysine is not the actual titratable H<sup>+</sup> sensor but instead a critical component of the gating machinery (<xref rid="bib24 bib37" ref-type="bibr">Leng et al., 2006; Rapedius et al., 2006</xref>). Thus, the specific identity of the pH sensor remains unknown.</p>
      <p>Mutations throughout the Kir channel have been shown to alter pH sensitivity (<xref rid="bib6 bib42 bib24 bib37" ref-type="bibr">Chanchevalap et al., 2000; Schulte and Fakler, 2000; Leng et al., 2006; Rapedius et al., 2006</xref>), suggesting that pH inhibition induces a global conformational change. In Kir1.1, pH inhibition is also intimately coupled to an inactivation process that depends on the extracellular K<sup>+</sup> concentration (K<sup>+</sup>-dependent inactivation). In zero or low concentrations of extracellular K<sup>+</sup>, Kir1.1 rapidly enters an inactivated state after pH inhibition. This inactivation can be prevented by the presence of extracellular K<sup>+</sup> and other permeant ions (e.g., Rb<sup>+</sup>, Cs<sup>+</sup>) and is thought to represent a collapse of the pore at the selectivity filter (<xref rid="bib10 bib44" ref-type="bibr">Dahlmann et al., 2004; Schulte et al., 2001</xref>), similar to the C-type inactivation seen in many Kv channels (<xref rid="bib1 bib26 bib47 bib48 bib53" ref-type="bibr">Baukrowitz and Yellen, 1996; Liu et al., 1996; Smith et al., 1996; Starkus et al., 1997; Yellen, 1998</xref>). However, the molecular mechanism which underlies the coupling between pH inhibition and K<sup>+</sup>-dependent inactivation is currently unknown.</p>
      <p>The activity of all Kir channels is dynamically regulated by PIP<sub>2</sub>, and depletion of PIP<sub>2</sub> in the membrane leads to a loss of channel activity. The exact PIP<sub>2</sub> binding site is currently unknown. However, many (mostly basic) residues which affect PIP<sub>2</sub> activation are found clustered in the cytoplasmic domains of the Kir channel and thought to represent the PIP<sub>2</sub> binding domain (<xref rid="bib3 bib4 bib14 bib28" ref-type="bibr">Baukrowitz et al., 1998; Bichet et al., 2003; Enkvetchakul and Nichols, 2003; Lopes et al., 2002</xref>).</p>
      <p>Another class of anionic lipids, long chain coenzyme A esters (LC-CoA), also modulate Kir channel activity by binding to a site which overlaps the PIP<sub>2</sub> binding site (<xref rid="bib36 bib38 bib45" ref-type="bibr">Rapedius et al., 2005; Rohacs et al., 2003; Schulze et al., 2003</xref>). In most cases, LC-CoA binding inhibits Kir channel activity by directly competing with PIP<sub>2</sub> for channel binding (<xref rid="bib36" ref-type="bibr">Rapedius et al., 2005</xref>). However, in K<sub>ATP</sub> channels (Kir6.2/SUR1), both LC-CoA and PIP<sub>2</sub> produce channel activation (<xref rid="bib5 bib38" ref-type="bibr">Branstrom et al., 2004; Rohacs et al., 2003</xref>). This regulation links Kir channel activity to cellular fatty acid metabolism (<xref rid="bib46" ref-type="bibr">Shumilina et al., 2006</xref>), fatty acid sensing in hypothalamic neurons (<xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr">Lam et al., 2005</xref>), and pancreatic insulin secretion (<xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">Branstrom et al., 2004</xref>).</p>
      <p>It is assumed that ligands that gate Kir channels (e.g., PIP<sub>2</sub>, H<sup>+</sup>, ATP, G proteins) initiate a conformational change in the cytoplasmic domains that is transduced to the TM helices and thereby open or close the pore. Furthermore, pore opening is thought to involve a widening of the pore at the helix bundle crossing (<xref rid="bib4 bib34 bib39 bib40 bib52" ref-type="bibr">Bichet et al., 2003; Phillips et al., 2003; Sackin et al., 2005; Sadja et al., 2001; Xiao et al., 2003</xref>). However, the precise conformational changes underlying these processes are not well understood, especially when compared to current knowledge about the gating mechanisms in other classes of ion channels (e.g., Kv channels and acetylcholine receptors).</p>
      <p>In this study, we demonstrate that both pH gating and PIP<sub>2</sub> gating in Kir channels share a common structural basis. We are also able, for the first time, to directly measure the kinetics of PIP<sub>2</sub> gating and pH gating, and we propose that these gating kinetics depend on the presence of an intrasubunit hydrogen bond between TM1 and TM2 at the base of the helix bundle crossing. Furthermore, we demonstrate that this gating mechanism is common to all Kir channels and that it not only controls their response to PIP<sub>2</sub> but also determines their pH sensitivity and response to extracellular K<sup>+</sup>.</p>

        <title>Measuring the Kinetics of PIP<sub>2</sub> Gating in Kir Channels</title>
        <p>Although activation by PIP<sub>2</sub> is common to all eukaryotic Kir channels, very little is known about the kinetics of PIP<sub>2</sub> activation and the underlying structural mechanism of gating. We therefore measured the time course of channel activation and deactivation in response to a rapid change in membrane PIP<sub>2</sub> content using two types of protocols. <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>A shows the response of Kir1.1 to the application of neomycin, which reversibly complexes membrane PIP<sub>2</sub>. Increasing the neomycin concentration resulted in a fast and stepwise reduction in channel activity with an IC<sub>50</sub> of 0.15 ± 0.05 mM and complete inhibition at 5 mM (Figures <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>A and <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>B). Removal of neomycin induced a monoexponential recovery of channel activity with a tau<sub>Neo</sub> of 18 ± 3 s which represents channel reactivation by the rebinding of PIP<sub>2</sub> (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>A).</p>
        <p>Likewise, subsequent to channel run down (induced by removal of 1 mM pyrophosphate and addition of 1 mM Mg<sup>2+</sup> to the bath solution to promote breakdown of endogenous PIP<sub>2</sub>) application of short chain PIP<sub>2</sub> (diC8-PIP<sub>2</sub>) resulted in stepwise channel reactivation with about 80% activation for 3 μM diC8-PIP<sub>2</sub> and a corresponding EC<sub>50</sub> of 0.9 ± 0.1 μM (Figures <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>B and <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>D). Channel reactivation by diC8-PIP<sub>2</sub> followed a monoexponential time course with a tau<sub>PIP2</sub> of 27 ± 3 s for 3 μM diC8-PIP<sub>2</sub> (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>B). Importantly, increasing the diC8-PIP<sub>2</sub> concentration to 30 μM had no effect on the speed of activation (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>C) indicating that it is not PIP<sub>2</sub> binding which is rate limiting for channel activation, but instead a subsequent conformational change (see cartoon in <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>D). The time course for channel reactivation induced by neomycin removal (tau<sub>Neo</sub> = 18 ± 3 s) and diC8-PIP<sub>2</sub> application (tau<sub>PIP2</sub> = 27 ± 3 s) were similar suggesting that the activation process we observe is similar for both endogenous PIP<sub>2</sub> and exogenous diC8-PIP<sub>2</sub>.</p>

        <title>A Residue in TM1 Controls the Speed of PIP<sub>2</sub> Activation</title>
        <p><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>A shows the position of lysine 80 in TM1 at the helix bundle crossing in a structural model of the Kir1.1 channel. This residue controls the ability of Kir1.1 channels to close in response to intracellular acidosis by an unknown allosteric mechanism. We therefore examined the role of K80 in PIP<sub>2</sub> gating. Mutation of K80 to valine (K80V) had little effect on the PIP<sub>2</sub> affinity as the concentration dependence for neomycin inhibition and diC8-PIP<sub>2</sub> activation were similar for K80V and wild-type (WT) channels (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figures 2</xref>B and 2D). However, K80V dramatically altered the kinetics of PIP<sub>2</sub> activation. The speed for activation induced by 3 μM diC8-PIP<sub>2</sub> (tau<sub>PIP2</sub> = 0.6 ± 1 s) or neomycin removal (tau<sub>Neo</sub> = 0.3 ± 0.1 s) was more than 45-fold faster compared to WT channels (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figures 2</xref>C and 2E). As observed in WT channels the rate of PIP<sub>2</sub> activation in K80V channels was similar for 3 μM and 30 μM diC8-PIP<sub>2</sub> (data not shown). The rate for channel deactivation upon diC8-PIP<sub>2</sub> removal in WT Kir1.1 channels was more variable and was faster (between 2 s and 21 s, see <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>C) than the PIP<sub>2</sub> activation rate but was not significantly different for WT and K80V channels (p &gt; 0.05). The variability in the deactivation time course most likely reflects differences in the washout time course of diC8-PIP<sub>2</sub> from the patch and, thus, likely not the deactivation gating kinetics of the channel.</p>
        <p>This observation that the K80V mutation dramatically altered the kinetics of PIP<sub>2</sub> activation without affecting PIP<sub>2</sub> affinity strongly supports the idea that the time course of PIP<sub>2</sub> activation represents a relatively slow conformational change that takes place subsequent to the PIP<sub>2</sub> binding step (as depicted in <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>D).</p>
      </sec>
      <sec id="sec2.3">
        <title>H Bonding at the Helix-Bundle Crossing Determines PIP<sub>2</sub> Activation Kinetics in Kir1.1</title>
        <p>We examined the effect of various residues at position 80 on the rate of PIP<sub>2</sub> activation. Mutation of K80 to valine (K80V), methionine (K80M), alanine (K80A), phenylalanine (K80F), serine (K80S), glycine (K80G), asparagine (K80N), and glutamate (K80E) all resulted in fast diC8-PIP<sub>2</sub> activation with tau<sub>PIP2</sub> values ranging from 0.6 to 0.8 s. The K80R mutation was nonfunctional (data not shown). These results indicate that neither the size nor polarity of the residue correlated with the speed of PIP<sub>2</sub> activation (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figures 3</xref>A and 3B). Furthermore, no obvious change in the deactivation time course upon diC8-PIP<sub>2</sub> removal was observed (data not shown) suggesting that these mutations primarily affected the activation process. However, mutation of lysine 80 to a glutamine (K80Q) resulted in a slow rate of activation with a corresponding tau<sub>PIP2</sub> of 16 ± 2 s. This suggested that the −NH<sub>2</sub> group present in both the lysine and glutamine side chains might be a structural requirement for the slow-gating phenotype.</p>
        <p>To better understand these findings from a structural perspective, we employed a combination of homology modeling and molecular dynamics simulations. We used a homology model of Kir1.1 created previously which was based upon the recently determined structures of KirBac1.1, KirBac3.1, and the intracellular domains of the Kir2.1 and Kir3.1 channels (<xref rid="bib37" ref-type="bibr">Rapedius et al., 2006</xref>).</p>
        <p><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>A depicts the location and orientation of Lys-80 and shows that the side chain ɛ-nitrogen points directly at the backbone carbonyl oxygen of alanine 177 in TM2 of the same subunit. The distance between these atoms varied from 2.8 to 3.0 Å in the four subunits in our closed-state model. This proximity is compatible with the formation of a hydrogen (H) bond between Lys-80 and Ala-177 (hereafter referred to as the TM1-TM2 H bonding).</p>
        <p>In principle, serine (Ser-80), asparagine (Asn-80), and glutamine (Gln-80) could also support a TM1-TM2 H bridge at this position. We therefore substituted different residues into position 80 of our homology model and examined their ability to form hydrogen bonds over a range of distances during a molecular dynamics simulation (see <xref rid="sec4" ref-type="sec">Experimental Procedures</xref> and see <xref rid="app2" ref-type="sec">Figure S1</xref> in the <xref rid="app2" ref-type="sec">Supplemental Data</xref> available with this article online). The simulations revealed that the lysine ɛ-nitrogen approached as close as 2.6 Å to the carbonyl oxygen of Ala-177, and was readily able to form H bonds, spending approximately 50% of the time H bonded at 310 K. By contrast, the asparagine nitrogen and serine oxygen only approached as close as 3.9 Å and 5.1 Å, respectively, owing to their shorter side chain length (depicted in <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>). Therefore neither residue is capable of forming H bonds as the length of a H bond is typically ≤3.0 Å. However, glutamine could approach as close as 2.7 Å but less frequently than lysine and, correspondingly, spent 5% of the time H bonded (see <xref rid="app2" ref-type="sec">Figure S1</xref>).</p>
        <p>Even though these simulations are an oversimplification of the in vivo situation, they nevertheless suggest that only Lys-80 and Gln-80 are capable of supporting TM1-TM2 H bonding in the closed-state model, which correlates qualitatively with the slow rates of PIP<sub>2</sub> activation seen for Gln-80 (tau<sub>PIP2</sub> = 16 ± 2 s) and Lys-80 (tau<sub>PIP2</sub> = 27 ± 3 s). Correspondingly, all those residues with fast rates of PIP<sub>2</sub> activation are either incapable of supporting an H bond because there are no hydrogen donors (Met, Ala, Val, Phe, Gly, Glu) or do not approach close enough (Asn and Ser).</p>
        <p>This apparent correlation between TM1-TM2 H bonding ability and the PIP<sub>2</sub> activation rate suggests that the activation energy for channel opening is determined by the ability of TM1-TM2 H bonding in the closed state. This is supported by a recent model of the open state of KirBac3.1, which demonstrated a large movement between TM1 and TM2 at the helix bundle crossing which would be expected to rupture any TM1-TM2 H bonding upon channel opening (see <xref rid="sec3" ref-type="sec">Discussion</xref>).</p>

        <title>A Conserved Gating Motif at the Helix Bundle Crossing</title>
        <p>Kir4.1 also has a lysine (Lys-67) at the homologous position to K80 in Kir1.1. We therefore investigated whether Kir4.1 demonstrates a similar mechanism of PIP<sub>2</sub> gating. <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>A shows that WT Kir4.1 also displays very slow diC8-PIP<sub>2</sub> activation (tau<sub>PIP2</sub> = 123 ± 23 s) consistent with a TM1-TM2 H bridge (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>A). Mutation of this lysine to methionine (K67M), to asparagine (K67N) and to glutamine (K67Q) dramatically sped up diC8-PIP<sub>2</sub> activation with corresponding tau<sub>PIP2</sub> of 3.7 ± 0.7 s, 3 ± 0.7 s, and 6.3 ± 0.1 s, respectively (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>A). Thus, in Kir4.1, only lysine appeared to show significant TM1-TM2 H bonding, although the somewhat slower rate of K67Q compared to K67M/N might indicate some H bonding. Thus the equivalent mutations in Kir4.1 also support a model in which TM1-TM2 H bonding at the helix-bundle crossing controls the rate of PIP<sub>2</sub> activation.</p>
        <p>This idea is also supported by the observation that wild-type Kir2.1, which possesses a methionine at this position (Met-84), was activated by diC8-PIP<sub>2</sub> with a tau<sub>PIP2</sub> of 14 ± 3 s, whereas M84K channels had a markedly slower rate of PIP<sub>2</sub> activation (tau<sub>PIP2</sub> = 84 ± 6 s). This result is consistent with the introduction of a TM1-TM2 H bridge in Kir2.1-M84K and suggests that the mechanism of gating at the helix-bundle crossing is highly conserved in the Kir channel superfamily.</p>

        <title>TM1-TM2 H Bonding Also Controls pH Sensitivity</title>
        <p>The presence of a lysine residue at the TM1 site has also been shown to determine the differences in Kir channel pH sensitivity. We therefore examined whether the proposed TM1-TM2 H bonding represents the structural basis for this by measuring the pH sensitivity of different K80 mutations in Kir1.1 and K67 mutations in Kir4.1 (<xref rid="app2" ref-type="sec">Figure S2</xref>) and plotted these values against the tau<sub>PIP2</sub> for PIP<sub>2</sub> activation (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref>). This plot reveals a clear correlation between the pH sensitivity (IC<sub>50</sub> values) and the PIP<sub>2</sub> activation rate (tau<sub>PIP2</sub>). In Kir1.1, the mutations K80V, K80M, and K80N all show low pH sensitivity (IC<sub>50</sub> ≈5.3). By contrast, K80Q had an intermediate pH sensitivity (IC<sub>50</sub> = 6.1 ± 0.1) and WT Kir1.1 the highest pH sensitivity (IC<sub>50</sub> = 6.5 ± 0.1). This correlates well with the rates of PIP<sub>2</sub> activation (K80M = K80N &gt;&gt; K80Q &gt; K80) and, thus, the TM1-TM2 H-bonding ability.</p>
        <p>A similar correlation was also observed for the pH sensitivity of Kir4.1 with low pH sensitivities for K67M, K67N, and K67Q with estimated IC<sub>50</sub> values around 4.2 (<xref rid="app2" ref-type="sec">Figure S2</xref>) and high pH sensitivity for WT (5.95 ± 0.05). Again, these values correlated with the PIP<sub>2</sub> activation rates that were markedly faster for K67N, K67M, and K67Q compared to WT. Furthermore, WT-Kir2.1 exhibited a low pH sensitivity (IC<sub>50</sub> = 5.3 ± 0.1) and relatively fast PIP<sub>2</sub> activation (tau<sub>PIP2</sub> = 14 ± 3 s), whereas Kir2.1-M84K displays a high pH sensitivity (IC<sub>50</sub> = 7.0 ± 0.2) and a markedly slower rate of PIP<sub>2</sub> activation (tau<sub>PIP2</sub> = 84 ± 6 s). These results suggest that this TM1-TM2 H bonding is the primary structural determinant for Kir channel pH sensitivity.</p>
        <p>A straightforward explanation is that protonation in the cytoplasmic domains induces channel closure and that H-bonding at the helix-bundle crossing stabilizes this closed state. If this hypothesis is correct, then this should also be reflected in the kinetics of pH gating and predicts a slowing in the rate of recovery from pH inhibition in Kir channels which possess TM1-TM2 H bonding at the helix-bundle crossing.</p>

        <title>Control of pH Gating Kinetics by H Bonding at the Helix-Bundle Crossing</title>
        <p><xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6</xref>A shows the time course of H<sup>+</sup> inhibition in Kir1.1 channels for different pH jumps and channel recovery upon alkalization to pH 8.0 using a piezo-driven fast solution exchange system. The inhibition and recovery kinetics displayed monoexponential behavior. The tau value for H<sup>+</sup> inhibition increased from 3366 ± 528 ms, to 455 ± 25 ms and 179 ± 21 ms for pH jumps to 6.3, 5.5, and 4.5, respectively, corresponding to 61% ± 3%, 92% ± 1% and 93% ± 1% of inhibition (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figures 6</xref>A and 6B). By contrast, channel recovery upon alkalization was independent of the pH used to induce inhibition (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figures 6</xref>A and 6B). In the same patches, the speed of solution exchange as determined with a K<sup>+</sup>/Na<sup>+</sup> replacement protocol was found to be much faster than the measured pH gating kinetics (tau ≈30 ms; <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6</xref>C). Thus, assuming that channel protonation/deprotonation is very rapid, the measured channel gating kinetics should reflect the conformational change subsequent to the protonation/deprotonation steps.</p>
        <p>Intriguingly, we found that the recovery rates from pH inhibition were markedly faster in mutants with K80 replaced by M, F, V, N, and E with corresponding tau values between 20 and 60 ms (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figures 6</xref>F and 6G). In these fast-gating mutants, recovery from pH inhibition closely followed the time course of the solution exchange (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6</xref>D), and thus, the real recovery-gating rates might actually be considerably faster. Consistent with our hypothesis, substitution of K80 by glutamine (K80Q) resulted in a slow recovery similar to WT (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figures 6</xref>F and 6G). Furthermore, the speed of H<sup>+</sup> inhibition was similar for WT and various K80 mutants (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figures 6</xref>E and 6G), suggesting that these mutations primarily affected the closed to open transition.</p>
        <p>Consistent with these observations, Kir2.1 recovery from pH inhibition was fast (tau = 36 ± 5 ms) but dramatically slowed upon introduction of the TM1 lysine (M84K; <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6</xref>H). The recovery time course in M84K channels appeared to be more linear than exponential and within 18 ± 1 s half of the channel activity recovered. In some patches a small (&lt;20%) faster initial phase was seen similar to that shown in <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6</xref>H. However, this fast phase was still more than 10-fold slower (tau = 385 ± 21 ms) than recovery in WT channels.</p>
        <p>As expected, recovery from pH inhibition in Kir4.1 channels was slow (tau = 4321 ± 566 ms). However, for the mutants K67M, K67N, and K67Q, a meaningful determination of the pH gating kinetics was not possible because pH inhibition was very weak (around 20% at pH 4.5; <xref rid="app2" ref-type="sec">Figure S2</xref>) and an initial activation occurred prior to the onset of inhibition (data not shown).</p>
        <p>In summary, recovery from pH inhibition was slow in Kir channels with TM1-TM2 H bonding (e.g., Kir1.1-WT/K80Q, Kir2.1-M84K) and fast in mutants lacking H bonding (e.g., Kir1.1-K80V, Kir2.1 WT), strongly supporting the concept of a conserved gating mechanism at the helix-bundle crossing for pH and PIP<sub>2</sub> gating in Kir channels that is controlled by TM1-TM2 H bonding.</p>

        <title>Gating at the Selectivity Filter</title>
        <p>pH inhibition in Kir1.1 is tightly coupled to a K<sup>+</sup>-dependent conformational change at the extracellular pore, i.e., in the absence of extracellular permeant ions (e.g., K<sup>+</sup>, Rb<sup>+</sup>, Cs<sup>+</sup>), the channels enter a nonconductive state subsequent to pH inhibition which is due to a collapse of the pore at the selectivity filter (<xref rid="bib10 bib44" ref-type="bibr">Dahlmann et al., 2004; Schulte et al., 2001</xref>). We therefore investigated whether this K<sup>+</sup>-dependent inactivation process can also be initiated by PIP<sub>2</sub> depletion and whether TM1-TM2 H bonding is involved.</p>
        <p><xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7</xref>A shows that PIP<sub>2</sub> depletion (normal run down) resulted in a permanent loss of Kir1.1 activity in the absence of extracellular permeant ions, i.e., addition of PIP<sub>2</sub> could not recover channel activity. The same results were also obtained using poly-lysine to induce PIP<sub>2</sub> depletion (<xref rid="app2" ref-type="sec">Figure S3</xref>). By contrast, in the presence of high extracellular permeant ions (e.g., K<sup>+</sup>, Rb<sup>+,</sup> and Cs<sup>+</sup>) activity was readily restored by PIP<sub>2</sub> (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7</xref>B). Likewise, Ba<sup>2+</sup>, which also binds in the selectivity filter, abolished K<sup>+</sup>-dependent inactivation (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7</xref>B). Furthermore, the rate of K<sup>+</sup>-dependent channel inactivation induced by PIP<sub>2</sub> depletion (tau = 15 ± 1 s) was similar to that obtained by pH inhibition (tau = 7 ± 1 s; <xref rid="app2" ref-type="sec">Figure S3</xref>), suggesting that PIP<sub>2</sub> depletion and pH inhibition both induce a similar inactivation process. This concept was further strengthened by the finding that mutations within the P loop (L136I, V140T) that abolish pH induced K<sup>+</sup>-dependent inactivation (<xref rid="bib44" ref-type="bibr">Schulte et al., 2001</xref>) also abolished inactivation induced by PIP<sub>2</sub> depletion (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7</xref>C).</p>
        <p>We next investigated whether TM1-TM2 H bonding is required for this K<sup>+</sup>-dependent inactivation process in Kir1.1. <xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7</xref>D shows that both WT and K80Q channels (showing H bonding), but not K80M or K80N channels (lacking H bonding), exhibited K<sup>+</sup>-dependent inactivation in response to PIP<sub>2</sub> depletion. Likewise, K80Q channels also exhibited pH-induced K<sup>+</sup>-dependent inactivation, but not K80V.</p>
        <p>These results demonstrate that the proposed TM1-TM2 H bonding at the helix-bundle crossing is essential for mediating the conformational changes within the selectivity filter which are thought to represent a collapse of the selectivity filter.</p>

        <title>Dissecting the Kinetics of PIP<sub>2</sub> Gating in Kir Channels</title>
        <p>In this study, we have established an assay which can measure the kinetics of Kir channel gating produced by a rapid change in the membrane PIP<sub>2</sub> concentration. Two protocols were used: (1) fast application of exogenous diC8-PIP<sub>2</sub> subsequent to depletion of endogenous PIP<sub>2</sub> (run down) and (2) sequestration of endogenous membrane PIP<sub>2</sub> with neomycin followed by its rapid removal which results in a sudden increase in endogenous membrane-bound PIP<sub>2</sub>. Both protocols resulted in monoexponential reactivation of Kir1.1 channel activity with similar rates (tau<sub>PIP2</sub> = 27 ± 3 s; tau<sub>Neo</sub> = 18 ± 3 s). Two lines of evidence indicate that PIP<sub>2</sub> binding to the channels is fast and that the measured activation rate is determined by a slow and rate-limiting conformational change which occurs subsequent to PIP<sub>2</sub> binding. First, the PIP<sub>2</sub> activation kinetics are not affected by the concentration of diC8-PIP<sub>2</sub>. Second, mutations in Kir1.1 (e.g., K80V) dramatically increased the rate of channel activation (tau<sub>PIP2</sub> = 0.6 ± 1 s; tau<sub>Neo</sub> = 0.3 ± 0.1 s) without affecting PIP<sub>2</sub> affinity, strongly suggesting that these mutations affect a conformational step subsequent to the PIP<sub>2</sub>-binding step. In other words, in response to a sudden jump in the membrane PIP<sub>2</sub> content, PIP<sub>2</sub> binds rapidly to the channel (faster than 0.3 s) and then induces a slow conformational change which represents the measured activation rate (as depicted in <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>D).</p>
        <p>For WT Kir1.1, deactivation upon diC8-PIP<sub>2</sub> removal or neomycin application was considerably faster (about 5-fold) than the rate of activation (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>C). Thus, the rates of activation and deactivation cannot be explained by a simple bimolecular reaction scheme, as this would predict a faster opening rate than closing rate given that activation was almost complete. Further, mutations (e.g., Kir1.1-K80V) dramatically increase the speed of PIP<sub>2</sub> activation without affecting the closed- to open-state equilibrium for a given PIP<sub>2</sub> concentration. This suggests a more complicated reaction scheme with several closed states where transitions that control the kinetics of PIP<sub>2</sub> activation have little impact on the overall open probability. A similar situation has been reported for Kv channels where mutations that dramatically speed up the activation kinetics have little effect on the steady-state voltage dependence (<xref rid="bib41" ref-type="bibr">Scholle et al., 2004</xref>). The existence of several closed states in the PIP<sub>2</sub> gating pathway also seems likely given the tetrameric structure of the Kir channel and four possible PIP<sub>2</sub>-binding sites.</p>
        <p>The ability to dissect the kinetics of PIP<sub>2</sub> gating should now allow a detailed insight into the PIP<sub>2</sub> gating mechanism by addressing important questions such as PIP<sub>2</sub> binding stoichiometry and subunit cooperativity, e.g., by using channels with fixed stoichiometries of slow- (e.g., WT) and fast-gating (e.g., K80M) subunits.</p>

      <sec id="sec3.2">
        <title>Comparison of the pH and PIP<sub>2</sub> Gating Kinetics</title>
        <p>Here, we also present the first measurements of the kinetics of pH gating by utilizing a fast application system. For WT Kir1.1, the tau for H<sup>+</sup> inhibition increases with higher H<sup>+</sup> concentrations from 3366 ± 528 ms at pH 6.3, to 455 ± 25 ms at pH 5.5, and to 179 ± 21 ms at pH 4.5. By contrast, recovery from H<sup>+</sup> inhibition upon alkalization (pH 8.0) was unaffected by pH. Given that channel protonation should be very rapid and that the solution exchange was sufficiently faster than the channel-gating kinetics, we can assume that the measured rates reflect the channel gating kinetics subsequent to the protonation and deprotonation steps.</p>
        <p>Similar to the effects seen during PIP<sub>2</sub> gating, the steady-state situation does not simply relate to the on and off rates since at pH 6.3 inhibition is much slower than recovery even though about 60% inhibition is obtained. This, again, points to a more complicated gating mechanism that awaits further detailed characterization. Yet despite these similarities, there are still important differences between the pH and PIP<sub>2</sub> gating mechanisms. First, the K80V mutation speeds the reopening kinetics and markedly reduces the pH sensitivity but does not alter the dose-response curve for PIP<sub>2</sub> activation. Another difference is the rate of channel reopening itself, which is much faster for pH gating compared to PIP<sub>2</sub> gating, indicating that the conformational changes (probably in the cytoplasmic domains) induced by either deprotonation or PIP<sub>2</sub> binding occur at different speeds. However, at the helix-bundle crossing the conformational changes appear similar since the kinetics of pH gating and PIP<sub>2</sub> gating are both controlled by the residue at the TM1 site, i.e., by TM1-TM2 H-bonding ability (see below).</p>
        <p>The ability to now measure the kinetics of PIP<sub>2</sub> gating represents an opportunity to separate effects on PIP<sub>2</sub> <italic>binding</italic> versus effects on PIP<sub>2</sub> <italic>efficacy</italic>, i.e., whether a mutation affects PIP<sub>2</sub> gating by directly affecting binding, or by indirectly affecting the steps subsequent to PIP<sub>2</sub> binding, or both (<xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">Colquhoun, 1998</xref>). Likewise, knowledge of the pH gating kinetics might help to gain an insight into the mechanisms that underlie the changes in pH sensitivity reported for many Kir channel mutants. Therefore, the ability to study both the pH and PIP<sub>2</sub> gating kinetics will provide a better understanding of mutations that produce Kir channelopathies by affecting the regulation by PIP<sub>2</sub> and pH (<xref rid="bib12 bib25 bib28 bib29" ref-type="bibr">Donaldson et al., 2003; Lin et al., 2006; Lopes et al., 2002; Ma et al., 2006</xref>). Furthermore, we demonstrate that neomycin and diC8-PIP<sub>2</sub> are useful tools to induce very rapid changes in the membrane PIP<sub>2</sub> content. This could be highly valuable to the study of other classes of ion channels that are also regulated by PIP<sub>2</sub> (<xref rid="bib18 bib33 bib50 bib55" ref-type="bibr">Hilgemann et al., 2001; Nilius et al., 2007, Suh et al., 2006; Zolles et al., 2006</xref>).</p>

        <title>Control of PIP<sub>2</sub> and pH Gating by a Putative TM1-TM2 H Bond</title>
        <p>Although an atomic resolution structure of Kir1.1 is ultimately required to prove this hypothesis, our collective findings provide compelling evidence that a hydrogen bond may exist between the ɛ-nitrogen of Lys-80 in Kir1.1 and the backbone carbonyl oxygen of Ala-177 at the helix bundle crossing and that this TM1-TM2 H bond represents an important structural determinant of Kir channel gating by PIP<sub>2</sub> and pH. The key observation was the striking correlation between the ability for TM1-TM2 H bonding in several different Kir channels (Kir1.1, Kir4.1, and Kir2.1) and their rate of channel opening induced by changes in either PIP<sub>2</sub> or pH. The fact that the TM1-TM2 H bond affected the rate of channel opening, but not closing, suggests that rupture of this H bond occurs upon channel opening. In agreement with this, recent structures of KirBac3.1 in both the closed state and the open state indicate a large rotation and tilt of the TM1 and TM2 helices during channel opening (<xref rid="bib22 bib11" ref-type="bibr">Kuo et al., 2005, Domene et al., 2005</xref>). We therefore used this open-state model of KirBac3.1 to produce a homology model of the Kir1.1 TM-helices in the open state (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Figure 8</xref>B).</p>
        <p>This model shows that the distance between the ɛ-nitrogen of K80 and backbone oxygen of A177 increases to &gt;12 Å in the open state and that such movement would clearly rupture any H bond between K80 and A177 as the channel moved into the open state (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Figures 8</xref>A and 8B). These TM1-TM2 movements are better visualized in the accompanying movie which depicts the hypothetical transition between closed- and open-state models (see <xref rid="app2" ref-type="sec">Supplemental Data</xref>, <xref rid="app2" ref-type="sec">Movie S1</xref>).</p>
        <p>Our observation that the effects of the proposed TM1-TM2 H bonding are conserved in both Kir1.1 and Kir4.1, and can also be transferred to Kir2.1 demonstrates a high degree of functional and structural conservation of the gating machinery in the Kir channel superfamily. The study also represents an important functional validation of the current models of Kir channel structure, including the proposed open-state structure of the KirBac channel.</p>

        <title>The Structural Determinant of Kir Channel pH Sensitivity</title>
        <p>It is well known that the presence of a lysine in TM1 (e.g., Kir1.1-K80) is a major determinant of pH sensitivity in all Kir channels (<xref rid="bib42" ref-type="bibr">Schulte and Fakler, 2000</xref>). However, the precise mechanism underlying the importance of this residue has remained elusive (<xref rid="bib37" ref-type="bibr">Rapedius et al., 2006</xref>). This study now presents a straightforward mechanistic answer; residues at this position (Lys and Gln) that can support H bonding produce channels with high pH sensitivity, whereas residues which cannot H bond produce channels with low pH sensitivity.</p>
        <p>We therefore propose a model in which protonation of the intracellular domains induces conformational changes that are transduced into gate closure at the helix-bundle crossing and that the pH-induced closed state is stabilized by TM1-TM2 H bonding. In strong support of this, the time course of recovery from pH inhibition was slow in Kir channels with TM1-TM2 H bonding (e.g., Kir1.1 WT and Kir2.1-M84K) but fast in Kir channels lacking TM1-TM2 H bonding (e.g., Kir1.1-K80M and Kir2.1), consistent with the concept that rupture of this H bond contributes to the activation energy for the closed- to open-state transition.</p>

        <title>H Bonding at the Helix-Bundle Crossing Gates the Selectivity Filter</title>
        <p>PIP<sub>2</sub> depletion triggers an inactivation process in Kir1.1 channels that depends on the extracellular ion composition. In the absence of extracellular ions that can enter the selectivity filter (e.g., K<sup>+</sup>, Rb<sup>+</sup>, Cs<sup>+</sup>, and Ba<sup>2+</sup>), PIP<sub>2</sub> depletion lead to irreversible pore closure, i.e., rebinding of PIP<sub>2</sub> could not recover channel activity. A similar ionic sensitivity has been reported when Kir1.1 is inhibited by low intracellular pH (<xref rid="bib10 bib44" ref-type="bibr">Dahlmann et al., 2004; Schulte et al., 2001</xref>). Furthermore, mutations in the P loop which abolish this pH-induced K<sup>+</sup>-dependent inactivation (<xref rid="bib44" ref-type="bibr">Schulte et al., 2001</xref>) also abolished PIP<sub>2</sub>-depletion-induced inactivation, demonstrating a common structural basis for this K<sup>+</sup>-dependent inactivation process.</p>
        <p>Intriguingly, we observed that K<sup>+</sup>-dependent inactivation in Kir1.1 also depends on the H bonding at the helix-bundle crossing. This demonstrates that interactions at this site are able to influence the selectivity filter. In other words, the TM1-TM2 H bond places the TM helices into a conformation that promotes the collapse of the selectivity filter (as depicted in <xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Figure 8</xref>C). The fact that this inactivation only proceeds from the closed, not the open state, is also consistent with our model in which this H bond cannot form in the open state.</p>
        <p>It will be interesting to establish how closely this mechanism of long range coupling between the helix-bundle crossing and the selectivity filter relates to the K<sup>+</sup>-dependent C-type inactivation seen in many Kv channels, HERG channels, and KcsA, and which is also thought to involve a structural change in the selectivity filter induced by a movement in the TM helixes (<xref rid="bib1 bib9 bib27 bib47 bib48 bib53" ref-type="bibr">Baukrowitz and Yellen, 1996; Cordero-Morales et al., 2006; Loots and Isacoff, 2000; Smith et al., 1996, Starkus et al., 1997; Yellen, 1998</xref>).</p>
        <p>Physiologically, this extracellular K<sup>+</sup> dependence of Kir1.1 channels represents a renal feedback system to prevent excessive K<sup>+</sup> loss during hypokalaemia (<xref rid="bib10 bib44" ref-type="bibr">Dahlmann et al., 2004; Schulte et al., 2001</xref>). Here, we report that PIP<sub>2</sub> depletion also sensitizes Kir channels to changes in the extracellular K<sup>+</sup>. This could be of significant physiological relevance since dynamic Kir1.1 regulation by PIP<sub>2</sub>-related mechanisms has also been observed in renal epithelia (<xref rid="bib54" ref-type="bibr">Zeng et al., 2003</xref>) and could therefore also be important for the functional role of neurons in chemosensitive areas of the brainstem which express Kir1.1 (<xref rid="bib51" ref-type="bibr">Wu et al., 2004</xref>).</p>

        <title>Conclusions</title>
        <p>We report that PIP<sub>2</sub> binding induces a conformational change in Kir channels which initiates at the cytoplasmic domains, followed by a movement of the TM helices that is controlled by a putative H bond at the helix-bundle crossing. This proposed structural mechanism also appears to be highly conserved during both pH gating and PIP<sub>2</sub> gating in several different Kir channels, thus pointing to an evolutionary conserved gating machinery in the Kir superfamily.</p>
        <p>We have also established that this Kir channel gating motif determines their pH sensitivity, their kinetics of PIP<sub>2</sub> and pH gating, and also links movements at the helix-bundle crossing to the structural changes within the selectivity filter. Many questions still remain elusive such as subunit cooperativity, the stoichiometry of PIP<sub>2</sub> binding, and the detailed gating schemes for PIP<sub>2</sub> and pH gating. However, the approaches described here for the direct measurement of Kir channel gating kinetics will now allow these questions to be addressed in the near future.</p>

Neomycin, poly-lysine, heparin, and long-chain L-α-Phosphatidyl-D-myo-inositol-4,5-phosphate (PIP<sub>2</sub>) were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. Short-chain (diC8) L-α-Phosphatidyl-D-myo-inositol-4,5-phosphate was purchased from AG Scientific. All substances were stored as stocks (1–10 mM) at −80°C and diluted in K<sub>int</sub> solution to final concentrations; long-chain PIP<sub>2</sub> was sonicated for 15 min and used within 2–6 hr.</p>

        <title>Assessing the Degree of Interaction between K80 and A177 in the Closed State of Kir1.1</title>
        <p>The coordinates for Ala-177 and Lys-80 were removed from the Kir1.1 closed-state model (<xref rid="bib37" ref-type="bibr">Rapedius et al., 2006</xref>) and, where necessary, the lysine was mutated to another amino acid residue. The residue at position 80 was then moved toward Ala-177 along an axis defined by the vector through their alpha carbon atoms, and every 0.25 Å, a conformation was saved using VMD1.8.4 (<xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr">Humphrey et al. 1996</xref>). Each of these conformations was then used to seed two in vacuo molecular dynamics simulations of 10 ns duration where the positions of the alpha carbons were fixed. Simulations were also performed where the entire TM backbones were fixed, and similar results were obtained (data not shown). The hydrogen-bond propensity was measured using VMD as a function of the separation between the two amino acid residues from this range of simulations. The distribution of distances between the two residues was also computed from these trajectories. All simulations were performed using NAMD2 (<xref rid="bib20 bib35" ref-type="bibr">Kalé et al., 1999; Phillips et al., 2005</xref>) and were analyzed using VMD. The CHARMM27 forcefield (<xref rid="bib30" ref-type="bibr">MacKerell et al., 1998</xref>), with explicit hydrogens, was used and all residues were kept in their default ionization states. A hydrogen bond is assumed to have formed if the distance between the donor and acceptor heavy atoms is &lt;3.5 Å and the angular deviation is &lt;30°. At each separation distance, 200 steps of energy minimization were performed followed by 10 ns of molecular dynamics. The first 2.5 ns were discarded from all calculations to remove any transient effects. No explicit waters were included, and SHAKE (<xref rid="bib31" ref-type="bibr">Miyamoto and Kollman, 1992</xref>) was used to allow an integration time step of 2 fs. A Langevin thermostat was applied to maintain the temperature at 310 K. Periodic boundary conditions were not used, and van der Waals and electrostatics were both calculated using a cutoff of 17 Å with a switching function applied from 15 Å.</p>

        <title>Making the Open-State Model of Kir1.1</title>
        <p>The key structural features of the homology model of the closed state of Kir1.1 were separately fitted onto the existing open-state model of the transmembrane helices of KirBac3.1 (<xref rid="bib22" ref-type="bibr">Kuo et al., 2005</xref>) in several stages. First, the sequences of Kir1.1 and KirBac3.1 were aligned. Then the inner, outer, and slide helices of the closed Kir1.1 model were structurally fitted onto the open-state model of KirBac3.1 (the inner TM2 helix was divided into two at the glycine hinge point). This generated an open-state model of the TM helices of Kir1.1 that closely resembled that of KirBac3.1. To help make clear the differences between the two states a movie was made by linearly interpolating between the two states (see <xref rid="app2" ref-type="sec">Supplemental Data</xref>). This is only intended to assist with a visualization of the types of motions that are likely to occur. The pictures and the movie were rendered using VMD (<xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr">Humphrey et al. 1996</xref>) which was also used to structurally align the proteins.</p>

          </caption>
          <p>This movie was produced by linearly tweening between the open and closed states using VMD. It illustrates the types of motions necessary to open the channel and the possible role of Lys-80 and Ala-177 in stabilizing the closed state. The view is from beneath the channel up through the pore. TM1, TM2, and the slide helix are shown in green, yellow, and red, respectively. The two amino acid residues (Lys-80 and Ala-177) are drawn as tubes and are colored according to element.</p>

        <p>Gating Models of Kir1.1</p>
        <p>(A) Bottom-up view through the pore of the closed-state structure of Kir1.1. TM1 is shown in green, TM2 in yellow, and the slide helix in red. Residues Lys-80 and Ala-177 are shown as sticks and colored CPK. The H bond between the ɛ-nitrogen of Lys-80 and the backbone carbonyl oxygen of Ala-177 is thought to stabilize the closed state of the channel.</p>
        <p>(B) The predicted open-state structure of the pore of Kir1.1. This model is based upon the open-state structure of KirBac3.1 and highlights the relative movement between the TM helices. The minimum distance between Lys-80 and Ala-177 increases from &lt;3 Å to &gt;12 Å in the open state and would therefore rupture any H bond between these residues upon channel opening. The relative movement between the helices can be better visualized in the accompanying movie (see <xref rid="app2" ref-type="sec">Supplemental Data</xref>, <xref rid="app2" ref-type="sec">Movie S1</xref>).</p>
        <p>(C) Cartoon depicting the contribution of the TM1-TM2 H bond to collapse of the pore. TM1 is shown in green, TM2 in yellow, and the slide helix in red. Either PIP<sub>2</sub> depletion or channel protonation induces channel closure at the helix-bundle crossing. With extracellular K<sup>+</sup> removed (zero [K<sup>+</sup>]<sub>ext.</sub>), closed channels enter an inactivated state (pore collapse at the selectivity filter) in channels with TM1-TM2 H bonding (e.g., WT Kir1.1 or K80Q). In this situation the channel remains in an “inactivated state,” even when PIP<sub>2</sub> is reapplied or the channel is deprotonated (upper gating pathway). However, in channels with no TM1-TM2 H bonding (e.g., K80V), inactivation is not possible and channels can open again upon the rebinding of PIP<sub>2</sub> or channel deprotonation even in the absence of extracellular K<sup>+</sup> (lower gating pathway). Note: the gate at the helix bundle crossing in the inactivated state (upper gating pathway) is shown to be open; however, this is just an assumption and requires further investigation.</p>
