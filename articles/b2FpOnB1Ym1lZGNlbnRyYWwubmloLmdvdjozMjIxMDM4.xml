        <title>Summary</title>
        <p>Pitch is a fundamental percept with a complex relationship to the associated sound structure [<xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Pitch perception requires brain representation of both the structure of the stimulus and the pitch that is perceived. We describe direct recordings of local field potentials from human auditory cortex made while subjects perceived the transition between noise and a noise with a regular repetitive structure in the time domain at the millisecond level called regular-interval noise (RIN) [<xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. RIN is perceived to have a pitch when the rate is above the lower limit of pitch [<xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>], at approximately 30 Hz. Sustained time-locked responses are observed to be related to the temporal regularity of the stimulus, commonly emphasized as a relevant stimulus feature in models of pitch perception (e.g., [<xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]). Sustained oscillatory responses are also demonstrated in the high gamma range (80–120 Hz). The regularity responses occur irrespective of whether the response is associated with pitch perception. In contrast, the oscillatory responses only occur for pitch. Both responses occur in primary auditory cortex and adjacent nonprimary areas. The research suggests that two types of pitch-related activity occur in humans in early auditory cortex: time-locked neural correlates of stimulus regularity and an oscillatory response related to the pitch percept.</p>

      <title>Results</title>
      <p>We recorded local field potentials (LFPs) from auditory cortex along Heschl's gyrus (HG) during presentation of a 1 s noise immediately followed by 1.5 s of regular-interval noise (RIN) [<xref rid="bib2 bib4" ref-type="bibr">2, 4</xref>]. RIN is constructed by delaying a copy of a noise waveform for a period of, say, d, and adding it back to the original noise (see <xref rid="app2" ref-type="sec">Figure S2</xref> available online). When this process is iterated a number of times, the resultant RIN exhibits temporal regularity at the period of the delay, which is heard as a pitch at 1/d, provided that 1/d is greater than the lower limit of pitch, which is about 30 Hz. RIN can be tailored to have the same long-term distribution of energy over frequency and time as the original noise, so it is an excellent stimulus for isolating neural activity associated with the processing of temporal regularity and the perception of pitch (e.g., [<xref rid="bib5 bib6" ref-type="bibr">5, 6</xref>]). <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref> shows time-locked responses for stimuli where 1/d is either 16 Hz (well below the lower limit of pitch) or 128 Hz (well above it); both stimuli are highly regular (constructed with 16 iterations), and so the 128 Hz stimulus produces a strong pitch. The 16 Hz RIN is perceived to repeat, but the perception is more like that of a motorboat rather than a tone. <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref> shows evoked potentials corresponding to the transition between noise and RIN, as well as the autocorrelation function of the evoked potential after the transition as a measure of the ongoing regularity in the response. There are peaks in the autocorrelation function corresponding to the stimulus regularity at 1/16 s for the 16 Hz stimulus and at 1/128 s for the 128 Hz stimulus. <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref> shows time-frequency analyses (<xref rid="app2" ref-type="sec">Supplemental Experimental Procedures</xref>) to demonstrate induced responses to stimuli with fixed regularity and different rates. <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref> shows gamma band activity in the 80–120 Hz range that is present for the two rates associated with pitch (128 Hz and 256 Hz) but not for the rate that is not associated with pitch (16 Hz). The gamma activity starts 50–70 ms after the transition from noise to RIN. It continues while the RIN is present and it has the same form irrespective of the pitch value. There was no low-frequency activity below the gamma range, as reported in previous visual studies [<xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>].</p>
      <p>The systematic effects of stimulus regularity and rate on the time-locked and induced responses are summarized in <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref> and <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>. The autocorrelation responses summarized in <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>B and <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>B are measures of ongoing regularity in the stationary evoked potential between 500 ms and 1200 ms after transition.

The early-induced gamma activity (100 to 300 ms) is summarized in <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>C and <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>C, and the late gamma activity (500 to 1200 ms) is summarized in <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>D and <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>D (see <xref rid="app2" ref-type="sec">Supplemental Experimental Procedures</xref> and <xref rid="app2" ref-type="sec">Figure S3</xref> for measurement of induced gamma power changes).</p>

The responses are not transition responses like the evoked potentials and are present 500 ms after transition. Subject 154 shows AC responses that increase as a function of regularity in the electrodes located in medial and middle HG up to electrode 10. These responses are never significant when there is no regularity in the signal and are always significant when there are more than two iterations present (with a single exception at electrode 10 for 32 iterations).

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>In this human study, stimulus representations are distinguished from perceptual representations in early auditory cortex. Direct recording of LFPs reveals a representation of stimulus regularity in the evoked responses and induced gamma responses related to the perception of pitch. The magnitude of the regularity response increases as the regularity of the RIN increases, and it continues throughout the duration of the RIN. Significant regularity responses occur both above and below the lower limit of pitch. Induced oscillatory responses are demonstrated in similar areas. These oscillations are significantly different from those occurring during the presentation of the preceding noise when the stimulus rate is above the lower limit of pitch. The responses to regularity demonstrated by autocorrelation are not transition responses but are steady-state responses that are present in the LFP more than 500 ms after pitch onset. Likewise, the gamma responses persist for the duration of the stimulus. Both responses occur in primary and adjacent nonprimary cortex.</p>
      <sec id="sec2.1">
        <title>Relationship to Animal Recordings from Single Neurons</title>
        <p>These human LFPs are ensemble responses from dendrites, as opposed to previous single-neuron recordings of spike activity [<xref rid="bib8 bib9" ref-type="bibr">8, 9</xref>]. Whether pitch representation requires single neurons or ensembles is debatable: consider spatial perception, for which single neurons are not adequate [<xref rid="bib10 bib11" ref-type="bibr">10, 11</xref>]. Nor is it clear whether the same pitch mechanism should exist in more than 200 primate species, let alone more distant species.</p>
        <p>Previous marmoset recordings [<xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] from a subarea abutting primary cortex showed responses in a proportion of neurons that were better defined in the pitch than the frequency domain. The study used a missing-fundamental stimulus, and the responses can be regarded as tuned in the domains of either stimulus regularity or perceived pitch. Using a less strict criterion for pitch tuning, a ferret study [<xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] showed an effect of pitch value on responses in multiple cortical areas. That study used spectrally shaped harmonic sounds, and it also cannot be uniquely interpreted in terms of stimulus or pitch representation.</p>
        <p>The present study shows that responses to both stimulus regularity and perceived pitch occur in neural ensembles in primary cortex and in an adjacent area. In the event that a universal mechanism for pitch analysis was to exist, these data would not localize it to one subregion. These rare human recordings do not allow sampling from the same number of auditory areas as does the ferret work.</p>
      </sec>
      <sec id="sec2.2">
        <title>Relationship to Human Studies</title>
        <p>One previous report describes direct pitch recordings from a part of HG [<xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] via a lateral approach. A previous study of ensemble activity, measured with magnetoencephalography, showed activity in medial HG corresponding to the transition between noise and RIN associated with pitch [<xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. The responses in that study are transition responses to the onset of pitch similar to the event-related potentials (ERPs) here. The current ERP study allows the direct localization of such ERPs to HG without source modeling. The maximal ERP responses in this study occur in the medial half of HG, consistent with the previous study.</p>
        <p>Ensemble activity to pitch-producing stimuli, measured indirectly with the fMRI BOLD response, demonstrates maxima in a part of HG that is more lateral than the gamma activity reported here [<xref rid="bib5 bib13" ref-type="bibr">5, 13</xref>]. However, it should be noted that there is overlap of the more medial activity in the Patterson et al. study with the gamma activity reported here (<xref rid="app2" ref-type="sec">Supplemental Experimental Procedures</xref>). The present finding that the maximal sensory and perceptual pitch responses are found medial to the BOLD maxima in the previous studies requires explanation, given the coupling between LFPs and BOLD shown in other studies [<xref rid="bib14 bib15" ref-type="bibr">14, 15</xref>]. One possible factor is the anatomical variability in lateral HG that might affect the electrode sampling, an issue that could be addressed by carrying out fMRI and depth electrode recording in the same subjects.</p>
        <p>Hall and Plack [<xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] recently suggested that identification of pitch processing centers in the brain requires pitch-related activity in the same region of the cortex for a wide range of pitch-producing stimuli (see <xref rid="app2" ref-type="sec">Supplemental Discussion</xref>). To satisfy such a conservative criterion, the current findings would require extension using different pitch-evoking stimuli. The current data, which suggest yoking between the anatomical position of a stimulus correlate and the associated perceptual correlate, raise the intriguing possibility that neural correlates of the pitch percept in early auditory areas might not be invariant with respect to the stimulus with which they are associated. If that were to be the case, it would call into question any obligatory requirement for neural correlates of pitch to be invariant with respect to the form of the stimulus.</p>
      </sec>
      <sec id="sec2.3">
        <title>Conversion of Stimulus Mapping to Pitch Mapping</title>
        <p>The data show that responses related to regularity and to perceived pitch are mapped to similar areas. This might be achieved within those areas by conversion of relevant stimulus parameters into a neural correlate of the percept. This is not the only mechanism, however, and another possibility is that higher areas that interpret the stimulus might cause local activity that is associated with the percept. Such a mechanism would be consistent with constructive models of auditory perception [<xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] that require top-down connections from nonprimary cortex. Such mechanisms have been previously suggested in both the visual [<xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] and auditory systems [<xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>].</p>

        <p>Time-Locked Responses at Different Stimulus Rates</p>
        <p>The top panels show the superior aspect of the temporal lobes, oriented such that the anterior pole is shown facing downward. Electrode locations (oriented along the axis of Heschl's gyrus [HG]) are superimposed. The lower part of the figure shows the event-related potential (ERP) and the autocorrelation of the ERP (AC) in separate pairs of columns for each subject, where the ERP and AC at each electrode are shown in different colors. Each row corresponds to a different electrode position marked on the sections at the top. The 16 Hz repetition rate does not produce a pitch percept; the 128 Hz repetition rate produces a strong pitch percept. The following abbreviations are used: A, anterior; P, posterior; M, medial; L, lateral.</p>

        <p>Time-frequency analyses showing event-related spectral perturbation (ERSP) corresponding to the transition between noise and the regular-interval noise (RIN) at each electrode in columns that correspond to the 16 Hz rate (in which no pitch is perceived) and the 128 Hz and 256 Hz rates (in which a strong pitch is perceived). A response with a latency of 70 ms is observed in the high gamma range (80–120 Hz), and it is in the same frequency range for pitch values of 128 Hz and 256 Hz. It is not present for the transition between noise and RIN with a rate of 16 Hz (in which pitch is not perceived).</p>

        <p>(A) Magnitude of the evoked potential at each electrode as a function of stimulus regularity, determined by the number of iterations in the delay-and-add algorithm used to make the stimulus. The onset response to noise is shown as a continuous line for comparison. A fixed pitch value of 128 Hz was used.</p>
        <p>(B) ΔAC represents the increase in autocorrelation of the response at a lag of 1/128 s, corresponding to the stimulus regularity; the dotted line shows the threshold for a significant autocorrelation response (see <xref rid="app2" ref-type="sec">Supplemental Experimental Procedures</xref>).</p>
        <p>(C) Increase in induced gamma power between noise and the early RIN response 100–300 ms after transition (expressed as a T score).</p>
        <p>(D) Increase in induced gamma power between noise and the late RIN response 500 to 1200 ms after transition. The dotted line shows the threshold for significant change in gamma when T = 1.96. The frequency axis shows responses from 40–200 Hz; no induced response was demonstrated below 40 Hz.</p>
