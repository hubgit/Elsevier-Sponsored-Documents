      <abstract>
        <p>In addition to its bioenergetic function of building up proton motive force, cytochrome <italic>bc</italic><sub>1</sub> can be a source of superoxide. One-electron reduction of oxygen is believed to occur from semiquinone (SQ<sub>o</sub>) formed at the quinone oxidation/reduction Q<sub>o</sub> site (Q<sub>o</sub>) as a result of single-electron oxidation of quinol by the iron–sulfur cluster (FeS) (<italic>semiforward</italic> mechanism) or single-electron reduction of quinone by heme <italic>b</italic><sub>L</sub> (<italic>semireverse</italic> mechanism). It is hotly debated which mechanism plays a major role in the overall production of superoxide as experimental data supporting either reaction exist. To evaluate a contribution of each of the mechanisms we first measured superoxide production under a broad range of conditions using the mutants of cytochrome <italic>bc</italic><sub>1</sub> that severely impeded the oxidation of FeS by cytochrome <italic>c</italic><sub>1</sub>, changed density of FeS around Q<sub>o</sub> by interfering with its movement, or combined these two effects together. We then compared the amount of generated superoxide with mathematical models describing either <italic>semiforward</italic> or <italic>semireverse</italic> mechanism framed within a scheme assuming competition between the internal reactions at Q<sub>o</sub> and the leakage of electrons on oxygen. We found that only the model of <italic>semireverse</italic> mechanism correctly reproduced the experimentally measured decrease in ROS for the FeS motion mutants and increase in ROS for the mutants with oxidation of FeS impaired. This strongly suggests that this mechanism dominates in setting steady-state levels of SQ<sub>o</sub> that present a risk of generation of superoxide by cytochrome <italic>bc</italic><sub>1</sub>. Isolation of this reaction sequence from multiplicity of possible reactions at Q<sub>o</sub> helps to better understand conditions under which complex III might contribute to ROS generation in vivo.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>In biological energy conversion, cytochrome <italic>bc</italic><sub>1</sub> (mitochondrial complex III) <xref rid="bb0005" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref> plays a role of connecting the quinone redox pool with the cytochrome <italic>c</italic> redox pool. The net oxidation of hydroquinone and reduction of cytochrome <italic>c</italic> catalyzed by this enzyme according to the Q-cycle <xref rid="bb0010" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref> through the action of two quinone oxidation/reduction sites (named the Q<sub>o</sub> and Q<sub>i</sub> sites) and the two chains of cofactors (the high potential c-chain and the low potential b-chain) contributes to generation of protonmotive force used for ATP synthesis. But in addition to this bioenergetic function, cytochrome <italic>bc</italic><sub>1</sub> is one of the complexes of mitochondrial electron transfer chain believed to contribute to the formation of superoxide that participates in cell signaling and contributes to cellular damage in aging and disease <xref rid="bb0015 bb0020 bb0025 bb0030" ref-type="bibr">[3–6]</xref>.</p>
      <p>The actual rate of superoxide production by cytochrome <italic>bc</italic><sub>1</sub> in mitochondria is debatable. Under physiological conditions it could be low and negligible compared with the maximum rates of superoxide production from complex I, the other component of electron transfer chain <xref rid="bb0020" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>. However, ROS generated in hypoxia have been attributed to originate from complex III <xref rid="bb0035" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>. In addition, there is an indication that the rate of superoxide generation by cytochrome <italic>bc</italic><sub>1</sub> may depend on the magnitude of the membrane potential, thus at high membrane potential, contribution from cytochrome <italic>bc</italic><sub>1</sub> may be larger <xref rid="bb0040" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>.</p>
      <p>In general, conditions that severely impede the electron flow through the cofactor chains of cytochrome <italic>bc</italic><sub>1</sub> induce production of superoxide. This occurs when the flow of electrons out of at least one of the chains is blocked, or severely inhibited, as for example in the presence of inhibitor antimycin which blocks the outflow of electrons from the b-chain <xref rid="bb0045 bb0050" ref-type="bibr">[9,10]</xref>, or in the presence of the heme <italic>c</italic><sub>1</sub> knockout mutation which impedes the electron outflow from the c-chain mimicking the conditions of hypoxia <xref rid="bb0055" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>.</p>
      <p>The production of superoxide is generally considered to be a side effect of the action of the catalytic quinone oxidation/reduction site — the Q<sub>o</sub> site (also referred as the Q<sub>P</sub> site). However, the mechanism of how this occurs remains elusive. Most postulated mechanisms assume that highly unstable semiquinone formed at the site (SQ<sub>o</sub>) is a direct source of single electrons that reduce oxygen to superoxide <xref rid="bb0050 bb0055 bb0060 bb0065 bb0070" ref-type="bibr">[10–14]</xref>. But SQ<sub>o</sub> is very difficult to detect experimentally which so far has only been achieved under special conditions that were able to trap SQ<sub>o</sub> at rather low occupancy levels <xref rid="bb0075 bb0080" ref-type="bibr">[15,16]</xref>. This implies that SQ<sub>o</sub> is formed, if ever, only very transiently and does not accumulate to significant levels when the electron flow through the cofactor chains proceeds unperturbedly. In addition, the multiplicity of possible reactions between the quinone/quinol and the two redox centers of the Q<sub>o</sub> site, the FeS cluster and heme <italic>b</italic><sub>L</sub>, <xref rid="bb0055 bb0070 bb0085" ref-type="bibr">[11,14,17]</xref> makes it difficult to discern which reaction sequence/sequences might be primarily responsible for generation of superoxide.</p>
      <p>Theory predicts that in the reversibly operating cytochrome <italic>bc</italic><sub>1</sub> <xref rid="bb0090 bb0095" ref-type="bibr">[18,19]</xref>, SQ<sub>o</sub> can be formed in two ways: as a part of the forward reaction toward oxidation of quinol when the oxidized FeS center withdraws one electron from quinol bound at the Q<sub>o</sub> site or as a part of the reverse reaction toward reduction of quinone when the reduced heme <italic>b</italic><sub>L</sub> donates its electron to the quinone bound at that site. We name those two ways as <italic>semiforward</italic> or <italic>semireverse</italic> mechanisms, respectively.</p>
      <p>Several studies have focused on examining the superoxide production occurring from SQ<sub>o</sub> formed through the <italic>semiforward</italic> mechanism because of its intimate relation to the initial steps of the forward direction of the Q-cycle <xref rid="bb0070 bb0100 bb0105 bb0110 bb0115 bb0120" ref-type="bibr">[14,20–24]</xref>. It was shown that the rate-limiting step for superoxide production in the antimycin-inhibited system is the same as for the Q-cycle and occurs at the level of direct one-electron oxidation of quinol to SQ<sub>o</sub> by the FeS cluster <xref rid="bb0110 bb0120" ref-type="bibr">[22,24]</xref>. However, recent studies have presented the <italic>semireverse</italic> mechanism as potent in contributing to superoxide production <xref rid="bb0055 bb0065" ref-type="bibr">[11,13]</xref>. In particular, Brandt and colleagues have shown that superoxide formation is stimulated by the presence of oxidized ubiquinone, which was interpreted as an indication that the reverse reaction from reduced heme <italic>b</italic><sub>L</sub> to quinone and further to oxygen does occur <xref rid="bb0065" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>. We have provided the mechanistic description as to how this might occur in light of the multiplicity of possible reactions at the Q<sub>o</sub> site (see below and ref. <xref rid="bb0055" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>).</p>
      <p>We examined the production of superoxide in cytochrome <italic>bc</italic><sub>1</sub> with mutations that severely impeded electron flow through the c-chain either by dramatically slowing the oxidation of the FeS center by cytochrome <italic>c</italic><sub>1</sub> (the <italic>c</italic><sub>1</sub> knockout) or by arresting the FeS head domain at the Q<sub>o</sub> site <xref rid="bb0055" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>, which otherwise undergoes movement between the Q<sub>o</sub> site and cytochrome <italic>c</italic><sub>1</sub> <xref rid="bb0125" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>. We proposed that a probability of the production of superoxide is inversely proportional to a probability of occurrence of competitive reactions engaging the cofactors of the Q<sub>o</sub> site. In the framework of this model we described conditions that promote the production of superoxide taking into account the effects of transient changes in distances between the cofactors caused by the movement of the FeS cluster <xref rid="bb0055" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>. Importantly, this model was compatible with both the <italic>semiforward</italic> and <italic>semireverse</italic> mechanisms of formation of SQ<sub>o</sub>.</p>
      <p>Here, with the help of additional mutations and mathematical modeling, we distinguish these two mechanisms in such a way that their relative contribution to the overall production of superoxide by cytochrome <italic>bc</italic><sub>1</sub> can be estimated. This allows us to describe the efficiency of single-electron reactions that under unfavorable circumstances lead to either short-circuit reactions or release of ROS.</p>

        <title>Preparation of cytochrome <italic>bc</italic><sub>1</sub> mutants and protein samples</title>
        <p>The single mutants + 1Ala, + 2Ala and M183K of <italic>Rhodobacter (Rba.) capsulatus</italic> cytochrome <italic>bc</italic><sub>1</sub> and the genetic expression system for this bacterium were a generous gift from Prof. Fevzi Daldal, University of Pennsylvania, USA.</p>
        <p>To obtain a double mutant M183K/+1Ala, the expression vector containing both mutations (pMTS1:M183K/+1Ala) was created in the following way: the plasmid pMTS1:M183K (containing a copy of <italic>pet</italic>ABC operon coding for all three subunits of cytochrome <italic>bc</italic><sub>1</sub> with mutation M183K in <italic>pet</italic>C) <xref rid="bb0130" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref> was digested with <italic>Xma</italic>I–<italic>Hind</italic>III and the resulting 0.22 kbp fragment was used to replace the <italic>Xma</italic>I–<italic>Hind</italic>III portion of pMTS1 that contained mutation + 1Ala in <italic>pet</italic>A <xref rid="bb0135" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>. pMTS1:M183K/+1Ala was conjugated into <italic>Rba. capsulatus</italic> strain MT-RBC1 devoid of <italic>pet</italic>ABC via triparental crosses as described previously <xref rid="bb0140" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref>.

        <title>Pulse EPR measurements of the FeS cluster</title>
        <p>Pulse EPR measurements were performed according to the procedures described in ref. <xref rid="bb0150" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref>. Prior to measurements all samples of cytochrome <italic>bc</italic><sub>1</sub> were dialyzed against 50 mM bicine buffer pH 8.0, 100 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, and 20% glycerol, and concentrated to approximately 200 μM of cytochrome <italic>c</italic><sub>1</sub>. All samples were reduced with 1 mM of sodium ascorbate and the EPR tubes containing ~ 10 μl of the sample were rapidly frozen by immersing in liquid nitrogen. Pulse EPR measurements were carried out on Bruker Elexsys-E580 spectrometer at Q-band (33.6 GHz). The spectrometer was equipped with ER5107D2/0501 Q-band resonator inserted in CF936 helium cryostat (Oxford Instruments). Electron spin echo (ESE) decay signal was recorded by measuring the amplitude of ESE excited by two-pulse sequence π/2–<italic>τ</italic>–π for <italic>τ</italic> increased by 4 ns. The phase relaxation rates were determined by fitting the stretched exponent to the ESE decay as described in detail in ref. <xref rid="bb0150" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref>. For temperature range 12–26 K changes in phase relaxation rates of the FeS cluster were approximated by fitting the sum of third order polynomial and Lorentzian function to the data points as described in ref. <xref rid="bb0150" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref>.</p>

        <p>Steady-state enzymatic activity of cytochrome <italic>bc</italic><sub>1</sub> and superoxide generation were performed as described in ref. <xref rid="bb0055" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>. Synthetic ubiquinol analog DBH<sub>2</sub> (2,3-dimetoxy-5-decyl-6-metyl-1,4-benzoquinol) and equine cytochrome <italic>c</italic> were used as substrates. The enzymatic assays were performed in 50 mM Tris buffer pH 8.0, containing 0.01% n-dodecyl-β-<sc>d</sc>-maltoside (DDM) and NaCl (100 mM or 400 mM). The final concentrations of substrates in all experiments were 20 μM. The final concentrations of cytochrome <italic>bc</italic><sub>1</sub> (referred to the concentration of cytochrome <italic>c</italic><sub>1</sub>) were in the range 10–100 nM, depending on the general activity of the particular mutant. The reaction was monitored by recording the time trace of absorbance at 550 nm after injection of appropriate amount of cytochrome <italic>bc</italic><sub>1</sub> to the reaction mixture containing the substrates. Turnover rates were calculated from the initial parts of the curves where the time dependence of cytochrome <italic>c</italic> reduction was linear.</p>

        <title>Simulations of steady-state kinetics</title>
        <p>Simulations were performed using the general approach and tools described in ref. <xref rid="bb0155" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref>. Two different kinetic models were built to follow the idea of two different possible mechanisms of superoxide generation by cytochrome <italic>bc</italic><sub>1</sub> as proposed in ref. <xref rid="bb0055" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>. The first model referred to as <italic>semiforward</italic> consisted of 11 stiff differential equations with 10 adjustable kinetic constants and the rate-limiting step in this model was the one-electron oxidation of QH<sub>2</sub> by the oxidized FeS center to form SQ. The second model referred to as <italic>semireverse</italic> consisted of 12 stiff equations with 11 adjustable kinetic parameters and the rate-limiting step involving a single-electron transfer from reduced heme <italic>b</italic><sub>L</sub> to Q at the Q<sub>o</sub> site to produce SQ. Other assumptions of the models are described in <xref rid="s0035" ref-type="sec">Results</xref>. The equations were numerically integrated using Gear's algorithm. The <italic>semiforward</italic> and <italic>semireverse</italic> mechanisms were simulated separately. The simulation of the combination of both of these mechanisms would require at least 21 adjustable parameters, which would introduce too many degrees of freedom making the reliable estimation of the parameters difficult.</p>
        <p>Initial parameters for all simulations were the same: oxidized cytochrome <italic>c</italic> 20 μM, reduced cytochrome <italic>c</italic> 0 μM, and cytochrome <italic>bc</italic><sub>1</sub> 100 nM. To reduce the number of equations and free parameters the concentrations of QH<sub>2</sub> and Q were kept constant throughout the simulations. At the beginning of the simulation it was assumed that the FeS cluster was completely oxidized and the head domain was at Q<sub>o</sub> site irrespectively of the mutant. The rate constants for all reaction steps were adjusted to reproduce enzymatic activity with and without antimycin in the presence and absence of added SOD.</p>

        <title>Distribution of positions of FeS cluster as seen in electron transfer and pulse EPR measurements</title>
        <p>It is well established that in wild type, the movement of the FeS head domain connects the Q<sub>o</sub> site with heme <italic>c</italic><sub>1</sub> within microseconds which is fast enough not to limit the overall catalytic rate. This movement is beyond the kinetic resolution of the flash-induced measurements of electron transfer in chromatophores. The alanine insertions in the neck region linking the water-soluble FeS head domain with its membranous anchor introduce steric barrier which interfere with the normal movement to various degrees <xref rid="bb0125 bb0135" ref-type="bibr">[25,27]</xref>. <xref rid="f0005" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref> presents schematically how those insertions influence the movement and thereby modify the distribution of positions of the FeS cluster in cytochrome <italic>bc</italic><sub>1</sub>.</p>
        <p>When the + 1Ala insertion is present, the cluster is forced to stay significantly longer at the Q<sub>o</sub> site (for microseconds) which is enough to effectively limit the rate of electron transfer to heme <italic>c</italic><sub>1</sub> to the point that it now becomes resolvable kinetically <xref rid="bb0135" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>. However, even though the cytochrome <italic>c</italic> re-reduction on a millisecond timescale of flash-induced measurements is slower, it is still highly effective and complete. Consistent with those observations, the steady-state activity of isolated enzyme on a second timescale is only moderately decreased to about 80 s<sup>− 1</sup> from the native 100 s<sup>− 1</sup> range (see <xref rid="f0015" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>). The enzyme remains physiologically functional.</p>
        <p>The + 2Ala insertion exerts much severer steric effect and arrests the FeS head domain at the Q<sub>o</sub> site for seconds <xref rid="bb0135" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>. The phases of cytochrome <italic>c</italic> re-reduction in millisecond flash-induced measurements are abolished <xref rid="bb0135" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref> and the steady-state turnover is decreased by nearly two orders of magnitude to about 2 s<sup>− 1</sup> <xref rid="bb0055" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>. This renders enzyme physiologically non-functional. Nevertheless, the residual activity of + 2Ala mutant still reflects the operation of the Q<sub>o</sub> site as it is abolished in the presence of the Q<sub>o</sub> site inhibitors (myxothiazol or stigmatellin) (see legend to <xref rid="f0015" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>). To sustain such turnover, the FeS cluster has to undergo cycles of oxidation and reduction, even on this second timescale, contrary to what was suggested in ref. <xref rid="bb0160" ref-type="bibr">[32]</xref>. Kinetically, even more severe effects can be observed by, for example, introducing thermodynamic barrier at the level of heme <italic>c</italic><sub>1</sub> (in the <italic>c</italic><sub>1</sub> knockout) <xref rid="bb0055" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>. The turnovers of less than 1 s<sup>− 1</sup>, seen in those mutants (see also the M183K mutant described below), are also due to the operation of the Q<sub>o</sub> site, thus again rely on oxidations and reductions of the FeS cluster. Operational Q<sub>o</sub> site in all those cases (+ 1Ala, + 2Ala and <italic>c</italic><sub>1</sub> knockouts) is a consequence of the fact that introduced mutations are remote from the catalytic site and do not alter its overall structural properties. This allows the oxidation of quinol to take place unperturbedly, as well documented in flash experiments where the native-like Q<sub>o</sub>-site-mediated reduction of heme <italic>b</italic><sub>H</sub> is observed as long as substrate quinol is provided and oxidized FeS cluster is present at the site <xref rid="bb0090 bb0165" ref-type="bibr">[18,33]</xref>.</p>
        <p>In a dynamic sense, it can be expected that the + 1Ala and + 2Ala mutations effectively change the density of the FeS cluster around the Q<sub>o</sub> site and along the trajectory of its movement toward heme <italic>c</italic><sub>1</sub>. In other words this can be described as a change in the average equilibrium distribution of the FeS positions. Such a change can be conveniently monitored in a glass state of frozen solution by measuring the dipolar enhancement of phase relaxation of the FeS cluster with pulse EPR <xref rid="bb0150" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref>. We have earlier observed that the relaxation of oxidized heme <italic>b</italic><sub>L</sub> enhances the phase relaxation of the FeS cluster in a distance-dependent manner; the closer the FeS cluster is to the Q<sub>o</sub> site (and heme <italic>b</italic><sub>L</sub>), the stronger the enhancement is. This is reflected as an increase in a local maximum in temperature dependence of the phase relaxation of the FeS cluster. Using the various effects of the specific Q<sub>o</sub> site inhibitors we were able to define the whole range of changes in the level of relaxation enhancement, correlating the changes with the shifts in the average equilibrium distribution of the FeS positions <xref rid="bb0150" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref>.</p>
        <p><xref rid="f0010" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref> compares the level of relaxation enhancement observed in the + 1Ala mutant with those reported earlier for the + 2Ala mutant and the wild type <xref rid="bb0150" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref>. The relaxation enhancement in + 1Ala is significantly weaker than in + 2Ala, but at the same time it is much stronger than in wild type. The strongest enhancement in + 2Ala correlates with the FeS head domain occupying the Q<sub>o</sub> site position most of the time (equilibrium distribution of positions is such that almost the entire population of FeS head domain is at the Q<sub>o</sub> site) <xref rid="bb0150" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref>. On the other hand the level of relaxation enhancement seen in wild type implicates existence of a broad distribution of positions between the Q<sub>o</sub> site and heme <italic>c</italic><sub>1</sub>, as discussed in detail in ref. <xref rid="bb0150" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref>. The relaxation enhancement of + 1Ala, placing itself in between those two cases, indicates that + 1Ala, in comparison to the wild type, has the density of the FeS cluster shifted toward the Q<sub>o</sub> site. The shift is in the same direction as in + 2Ala, but not as large. It is consistent with the notion, coming from the interpretation of kinetic and biochemical data, that in + 1Ala the FeS head domain is held at the Q<sub>o</sub> site in a similar manner as in + 2Ala, but for a significantly shorter time (milliseconds vs seconds) <xref rid="bb0135" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>. We note that changes in the relaxation enhancement definitely rule out the possibility that the observed kinetic impediments in + 1Ala are due to the slowing of the movement of the FeS head domain uniformly along the whole trajectory. In such a case, the average distribution of the FeS positions would not change significantly vs wild type, thus no changes in the relaxation enhancement would have been observed <xref rid="bb0150" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref>.</p>
        <p>Overall, the data in <xref rid="f0010" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref> provide direct spectroscopic demonstration that a density of the FeS cluster at the Q<sub>o</sub> site does differ in each of the form. This density decreases in the order + 2Ala, + 1Ala, wild type.</p>

        <title>Effect of mutations on the level of superoxide production by cytochrome <italic>bc</italic><sub>1</sub></title>
        <p>In vitro measurements with isolated cytochrome <italic>bc</italic><sub>1</sub> indicate that the native form of this enzyme does not produce superoxide at detectable levels unless the electron flow through the cofactor chains is severely impeded and, consequently, the chains become saturated with electrons (i.e. cofactors remain in reduced state for a prolonged time). One classic example involves conditions where the outflow of electrons from the b-chain is blocked by antimycin at the level of the Q<sub>i</sub> site. This traps hemes <italic>b</italic> in the reduced state. We reported earlier that isolated form of <italic>Rba. capsulatus</italic> cytochrome <italic>bc</italic><sub>1</sub> under those conditions produces 17% of superoxide<xref rid="fn0005" ref-type="fn">1</xref> at 100 mM NaCl or 26% at 400 mM NaCl (<xref rid="f0015" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>a) <xref rid="bb0055" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>. At the same time we noted that the generation of superoxide associated with the blockage of the Q<sub>i</sub> site can effectively be enhanced by impeding the electron outflow from the c-chain. In the M183L mutant detectable levels of superoxide were observed even in the absence of antimycin, at higher concentrations of quinol and/or at high salt concentration (400 mM NaCl). In the presence of antimycin the levels of superoxide production were higher than the respective levels in the wild type <xref rid="bb0055" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>.</p>
        <p>We now extend this analysis to show that another mutant of the same type (M183K) exhibits a very similar pattern as M183L. Again, superoxide production can be observed even in the absence of antimycin at high QH<sub>2</sub> concentration and/or at high ionic strength: when the initial concentration of QH<sub>2</sub> is increased from 20 to 100 μM, superoxide is generated at 16% at 100 mM NaCl (not shown), while at 400 mM NaCl, 22.5% of superoxide is generated even with 20 μM initial QH<sub>2</sub> (<xref rid="f0015" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>b). In the presence of antimycin, the levels reach 30% at 100 mM NaCl or 35% at 400 mM NaCl (<xref rid="f0015" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>b) which is higher than in the wild type (<xref rid="f0015" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>a).</p>
        <p>In those experiments increasing the concentration of quinol increases the extent to which the reverse Q<sub>i</sub> to heme <italic>b</italic><sub>H</sub> reaction interferes with the forward reaction making the flow of electrons through the b-chain in the forward direction more difficult. On the other hand, increase in the ionic strength inhibits the interaction between cytochrome <italic>c</italic> and <italic>c</italic><sub>1</sub> making the flow of electrons through the c-chain more difficult <xref rid="bb0170" ref-type="bibr">[34]</xref>. The former effect increases a probability of saturation of the b-chain with electrons that come from both the forward and reverse directions; the latter — increases a probability of saturation of the c-chain with electrons that come from the forward reaction at the Q<sub>o</sub> site.</p>
        <p>Clearly, testing those effects in various combinations on both forms of the <italic>c</italic><sub>1</sub> knockouts (M183L and M183K) consistently indicates that the saturation of the c-chain with electrons when the b-chain is also saturated with electrons effectively increases the level of superoxide production by cytochrome <italic>bc</italic><sub>1</sub>.</p>
        <p>Our earlier studies showed that + 2Ala motion knockout does not produce a statistically significant amount of superoxide under any conditions, even in the presence of antimycin. We related this with large increase in the density of the FeS cluster around the Q<sub>o</sub> site and the resulting increase in the probability of occurrence of competitive reactions at the Q<sub>o</sub> site that retain electrons within the protein instead of releasing them on oxygen. This was generally formulated in a model described in ref. <xref rid="bb0055" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>. The + 1Ala mutant, which as we show here has a density of the FeS cluster at the Q<sub>o</sub> site decreased with respect to the + 2Ala yet significantly increased with respect to the wild type (<xref rid="f0010" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>), provides the very useful set of additional conditions with which the effect of change in the density of the FeS cluster on the level of superoxide production can be examined. The most straightforward prediction of our model is that the forms of cytochrome <italic>bc</italic><sub>1</sub> with the + 1Ala insertion might show reduced levels of superoxide production when compared with the forms without this insertion if only the FeS domain is held at the Q<sub>o</sub> site for sufficient time to effectively increase the contribution from competitive reactions.</p>
        <p><xref rid="f0015" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>c and d confirms this to be the case. Under the experimental conditions of this figure, the production of superoxide in + 1Ala mutant, as in the wild type, can only be observed in the presence of antimycin (<xref rid="f0015" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>c). However, the level of superoxide production is clearly diminished vs wild type, at both 100 mM and 400 mM NaCl (9.5% vs 17%, and 12.5% vs 26%, respectively). Likewise, an addition of + 1Ala mutation to the M183K <italic>c</italic><sub>1</sub> knockout (M183K/+1Ala double mutant) generally decreases the level of superoxide production seen in the M183K mutant alone; in all cases where the production of superoxide was observed in M183K, superoxide was also produced in M183K/+1Ala albeit the overall percentage was significantly reduced (<xref rid="f0015" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>d). These results clearly confirm the correlation between the density of the FeS cluster at the Q<sub>o</sub> site and the observable level of superoxide produced by cytochrome <italic>bc</italic><sub>1</sub>: the higher the FeS density, the lower the ROS level.</p>
        <p>We note that the properties of + 1Ala dismiss the possibility that the suppression in ROS production is just due to the change in the steady-state quinol oxidation rate. This is because despite the substantial increase in the FeS cluster density at the Q<sub>o</sub> site in + 1Ala, its steady-state turnover is comparable to the native system (<xref rid="f0015" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>), quite differently from + 2Ala, in which density of the FeS at that site is almost maximal and the enzymatic activity is much reduced.</p>

        <title>Kinetic model of superoxide production by the Q<sub>o</sub> site</title>
        <p>Our kinetic model analyzed separately two sets of conditions: one encountered by the enzyme when semiquinone is formed in <italic>semiforward</italic> reaction; the other — when it is formed in <italic>semireverse</italic> reaction. The latter is shown in <xref rid="f0020" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref>a.</p>
        <p>We first asked a question whether the modeling can discriminate quantitatively the <italic>semiforward</italic> and <italic>semireverse</italic> mechanisms. If it cannot, we are unable to draw any conclusions about contribution of the particular mechanism to the overall production of superoxide. If, however, it does discriminate those two mechanisms and the modeling one of them follows the experimental data, then we get a strong indication as to which mechanism of superoxide production is dominant.</p>
        <p>The model simulated steady-state kinetic curves of cytochrome <italic>c</italic> reduction by different forms of cytochrome <italic>bc</italic><sub>1</sub> taking into account the following general assumptions: 1) all reactions are independent of each other; 2) the reactions in the b-chain are simplified to describe only the changes in the redox state of heme <italic>b</italic><sub>L</sub>; 3) the absence of antimycin is modeled by an addition of the reaction that allows rapid oxidation of heme <italic>b</italic><sub>L</sub> but not through the other components of the Q<sub>o</sub> site (this reaction is omitted in the presence of antimycin); 4) changes in the density of the FeS cluster caused by the movement of the head domain are approximated to the transitions between the three states: <italic>Q</italic><sub><italic>o</italic></sub>, <italic>in-between</italic>, and <italic>c</italic><sub>1</sub> states (1, 2, and 3 in <xref rid="f0020" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref>b, respectively); 5) the transitions from each of the state (<italic>Q</italic><sub><italic>o</italic></sub>, <italic>in-between</italic>, and <italic>c</italic><sub>1</sub>) to its neighboring states are random (independent of each other and not influenced by the redox state of any cofactor); 6) in the <italic>Q</italic><sub><italic>o</italic></sub> state the FeS cluster can exchange electron with the occupant of the Q<sub>o</sub> site, in the <italic>c</italic><sub>1</sub> state the FeS cluster can reduce cytochrome <italic>c</italic> (because of the initial excess of substrates, oxidized cytochrome <italic>c</italic> and quinol; the electron transfer from cytochrome <italic>c</italic> back to the FeS cluster is neglected), in the <italic>in</italic>-<italic>between</italic> state the FeS cluster cannot exchange electrons with any cofactor; 7) spontaneous dismutation of superoxide is neglected; and 8) the effect of addition of superoxide dismutase in the ROS assay is modeled by eliminating the reaction of reduction of cytochrome <italic>c</italic> by superoxide anion.</p>
        <p><xref rid="f0020" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref>c shows simulations obtained with the parameters found to best reproduce the whole set of experimental data. These simulations show reduction of cytochrome <italic>c</italic> by wild type and various mutants of cytochrome <italic>bc</italic><sub>1</sub> when the set of conditions associated with the <italic>semireverse</italic> SQ<sub>o</sub> formation (<xref rid="f0020" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref>a) is considered. The model indicates no ROS generation in the “absence” of antimycin, but in its “presence” simulations clearly indicate ROS generation with the extent varying depending on which forms are analyzed. The simulated levels follow the order M183K (34%), M183K/+1Ala (21%), WT (18%), + 1Ala (9.6%), and + 2Ala (~ 1%), which is in remarkable agreement with the experimental data. More specifically, the model neatly reproduces two opposite effects: suppression of ROS production in the forms with increased density of the FeS cluster at the Q<sub>o</sub> site (it shows almost no ROS in + 2Ala and a suppression caused by + 1Ala in both the WT and M183K backgrounds) and increase in the ROS production when the oxidation of the FeS cluster by cytochrome <italic>c</italic><sub>1</sub> is suppressed (M183K).</p>
        <p>When the set of conditions associated with the <italic>semiforward</italic> SQ<sub>o</sub> formation was examined in the same way, the model could not reproduce the experimental data for all the mutants. In particular, as shown in <xref rid="f0020" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref>d, the model could not produce the, revealed by experiment and obtained with the previous set of modeling, opposite effects of + 2Ala and M183K. With various parameters tested, the changes in ROS production for + 2Ala and M183K always run in the same direction (the model predicts increase in the level of ROS in both mutants).</p>
        <p>It is thus clear that the model discriminates between <italic>semiforward</italic> and <italic>semireverse</italic> mechanisms and that the results of modeling of the <italic>semireverse</italic> mechanism are consistent with the experimental data for the wild type and all the tested mutants. This suggests that this mechanism might be dominant in the overall process of ROS generation by cytochrome <italic>bc</italic><sub>1</sub>.</p>

        <title>Correlation between the density of FeS at Q<sub>o</sub> and the level of ROS</title>
        <p>The results of this work are consistent with the notion that the presence of the FeS cluster at the Q<sub>o</sub> site effectively diminishes probability of formation of superoxide. We show that not only the mutation (+ 2Ala) that arrests the FeS head domain for seconds at the Q<sub>o</sub> site suppresses the ROS production to almost zero <xref rid="bb0055" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>, but also a mutation (+ 1Ala) that prolongs the time this domain spends at the site (from native sub-milliseconds to milliseconds) <xref rid="bb0135" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref> effectively decreases the level of ROS production when compared to the wild type (<xref rid="f0015" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>). We explain this correlation between the density of the FeS cluster at the Q<sub>o</sub> site and the level of superoxide production with the model that assumes a competition between the internal reactions involving the cofactors and quinone at the Q<sub>o</sub> site and the reaction of semiquinone with oxygen. This model was discussed in detail in ref. <xref rid="bb0055" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>.</p>
        <p>Inherent to this model is that it is exclusively kinetic: it assumes nothing more but changes in the reaction rates between the redox-active components of the Q<sub>o</sub> site. Upon the FeS head domain movement, a transient increase in the distance between the FeS cluster and the remaining portion of the site slows the electron tunneling <xref rid="bb0175 bb0180" ref-type="bibr">[35,36]</xref> between the FeS cluster and quinone (Q or QH or SQ) at the site. When this occurs, the probability that the FeS cluster participates in an immediate removal of SQ<sub>o</sub> decreases, and, consequently, the probability of the reaction of SQ<sub>o</sub> with oxygen to form superoxide increases.</p>
        <p>The changes in electron tunneling rates constituted basis of the concept of transient “opening” of the Q<sub>o</sub> site for the reaction with oxygen introduced originally in ref. <xref rid="bb0055" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>. Unlike what was suggested in ref. <xref rid="bb0120" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>, this concept never referred to any specific gating mechanism by which enzyme would control generation of superoxide, for example by the formation of the physical gate for oxygen molecules to enter or exit the site through the FeS head domain moving out of the Q<sub>o</sub> site. In fact, if one considers the ability of oxygen molecules to penetrate membrane and even protein matrix <xref rid="bb0185 bb0190 bb0195 bb0200" ref-type="bibr">[37–40]</xref> it seems rather unlikely that the site can ever be completely sealed from molecular oxygen.</p>
        <p>Our model assumes no change in the rate constant for reaction between SQ<sub>o</sub> and oxygen. It only assumes that a contribution of other reactions at the Q<sub>o</sub> site decreases steady-state level of SQ<sub>o</sub> reflected as a decrease in the average level of produced ROS.</p>

        <title>Majority of SQ<sub>o</sub> prerequisite of ROS is formed via <italic>semireverse</italic> mechanism</title>
        <p>Until now, the presented model has only described how the FeS cluster competes with oxygen for reaction with highly reactive SQ<sub>o</sub>. It has not identified the reaction sequence leading to formation of SQ<sub>o</sub>, which in the reversibly operating cytochrome <italic>bc</italic><sub>1</sub> may involve either the <italic>semiforward</italic> single-electron oxidation of QH<sub>2</sub> by FeS or the <italic>semireverse</italic> single-electron reduction of Q by heme <italic>b</italic><sub>L</sub>. This important identification has proven possible when experimental data were quantitatively analyzed by the kinetic model describing either <italic>semiforward</italic> or <italic>semireverse</italic> mechanism following the logic discussed in <xref rid="s0035" ref-type="sec">Results</xref>.</p>
        <p>The analysis clearly indicated that the dominant process in the superoxide production involves leaks of electrons from SQ<sub>o</sub> formed in the <italic>semireverse</italic> reaction (<xref rid="f0020" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref>), which is in line with recent mechanism proposed for the mitochondrial complex III <xref rid="bb0065 bb0205" ref-type="bibr">[13,41]</xref>. This conclusion was drawn from the observation that only the model describing the <italic>semireverse</italic> mechanism was capable of reproducing the data for all tested conditions and mutants. Because in this mechanism the creation of SQ<sub>o</sub> is independent on the actual position of the FeS cluster, the model predicted the progressive increase in the efficiency of competitive reactions involving the FeS cluster (decrease in the level of ROS) when its density at the Q<sub>o</sub> site increases (+ 1Ala and + 2Ala mutants). At the same time, because only the oxidized FeS cluster can complete short-circuit reaction which adds to the measured SOD-insensitive turnover (<xref rid="f0020" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref>a, short-circuit SOD-insensitive), the model predicted increase in the level of ROS when the oxidation of the FeS cluster is impeded (M183K).</p>
        <p>The failure of the model describing the <italic>semiforward</italic> mechanism can be related to the fact that, unlike in the <italic>semireverse</italic> mechanism, the formation of SQ<sub>o</sub> requires the presence of the oxidized FeS cluster at the Q<sub>o</sub> site. Thus the rate of SQ<sub>o</sub> generation and the rate of its elimination by the cofactors of the Q<sub>o</sub> site (FeS and heme <italic>b</italic><sub>L</sub>) might be strongly correlated. As a result this model predicted similar direction of change in the level of ROS production when oxidation of the FeS cluster by cytochrome <italic>c</italic> is impeded (M183K) or the movement of FeS toward cytochrome <italic>c</italic><sub>1</sub> is impeded (+ 2Ala). This, however, was not supported experimentally.</p>
        <p>It should be noted that we do not discard the possibility that ROS production in cytochrome <italic>bc</italic><sub>1</sub> is the effect of the combination of both <italic>semiforward</italic> and <italic>semireverse</italic> mechanisms. Only, as our data and modeling suggest, we maintain that the contribution of the <italic>semiforward</italic> mechanism is likely to be minor.</p>

        <title>Concluding remarks with connotation to physiology</title>
        <p>The models developed here are consistent with the notion that the uninhibited electron flow through the cofactors chains of cytochrome <italic>bc</italic><sub>1</sub> involves the two-electron oxidation/reduction of quinol/quinone at the Q<sub>o</sub> site which is unlikely to be a source of deleterious radicals. This is because the catalytic reactions appear to be fast enough that reaction of SQ<sub>o</sub> with oxygen cannot effectively compete with them. However, severe inhibition of electron flow (such as that caused by antimycin or mutations shown here) that maintains long-lasting reduced states of cofactors (heme <italic>b</italic><sub>L</sub> and/or the FeS cluster) switches a number of additional one-electron reactions that can lead to short circuits or leaks of electrons out of the Q<sub>o</sub> site <xref rid="bb0055 bb0065 bb0070 bb0085" ref-type="bibr">[11,13,14,17]</xref>. Our experimental analysis of broad set of conditions combined with modeling revealed that formation of SQ<sub>o</sub> by the reverse heme <italic>b</italic><sub>L</sub> to quinone electron transfer (<italic>semireverse</italic> mechanism) dominates in setting the steady-state levels of SQ<sub>o</sub> that present a risk of generation superoxide. With constantly moving FeS head domain (kinetic studies indicate that the FeS cluster equilibrates with both of its partners on a millisecond timescale independently of its redox state and of the redox state of the partners <xref rid="bb0155" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref>), the risk of electron escape from SQ<sub>o</sub> to oxygen associated with an occurrence of a given heme <italic>b</italic><sub>L</sub> to quinone electron transfer depends on the actual position of the FeS head: it is much smaller when the FeS head domain occupies positions close/within the Q<sub>o</sub> site and is much larger when it occupies positions remote from the site.</p>
        <p>It follows from these scenarios, that not only states with over reduced hemes <italic>b</italic> (mimicked by antimycin) as commonly envisaged, but also states with over reduced hemes <italic>c</italic> (mimicked by the heme <italic>c</italic><sub>1</sub> knockout mutants described here and in ref. <xref rid="bb0055" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>) present a potential risk for release of superoxide from complex III. The latter states refer not only to conditions where the oxidation of cytochrome <italic>c</italic> would be effectively inhibited at the level of cytochrome <italic>c</italic> oxidase, for example under low oxygen or inhibition by nitric oxide, but also to conditions where the pool of soluble cytochrome <italic>c</italic> is significantly reduced or damaged, for example during cytochrome <italic>c</italic> release in apoptosis (<xref rid="bb0020" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref> and refs therein).</p>
        <p>Obviously, all those states are interconnected with the redox state of the quinone pool and the magnitude of the membrane potential. For example, build up of QH<sub>2</sub> when oxidation of cytochrome <italic>c</italic> is inhibited can result in an increased pressure from the reverse reaction through the Q<sub>i</sub> site that elevates the level of reduced hemes <italic>b</italic>. Also increase in the membrane potential may have similar effect of enforcing hemes <italic>b</italic> to remain reduced. On the other hand, as oxidized quinone is a substrate in <italic>semireverse</italic> mechanism of SQ<sub>o</sub> formation, it becomes clear that a proportion of oxidized quinone in the membranous pool might influence the levels of ROS, even to the point that the redox state of the quinone pool could contribute significantly to the control of superoxide production by complex III and, thereby, to the control of mitochondrial redox signaling, as proposed by Brandt et al. <xref rid="bb0065 bb0205" ref-type="bibr">[13,41]</xref>.</p>
        <p>It is quite possible that all those states gain physiological meaning under the resting metabolic state of mitochondria when the respiration rate slows and electrons have better chance to reside longer at individual redox-active sites. As discussed here, with the long-lasting reduced states of the FeS cluster and/or heme <italic>b</italic><sub>L</sub> and constantly moving FeS head domain (there is little reason to suppose that the mobility of the FeS head domain would be affected) there is a potential risk that superoxide can be generated by the Q<sub>o</sub> site of complex III. This would be in line with a view that it is a decreased rather than an increased metabolic rate that leads to increased generation of ROS <xref rid="bb0210" ref-type="bibr">[42]</xref>. Much remains to be learned in this respect, but we believe that a dynamic description of reaction sequences at the Q<sub>o</sub> site presented here sheds some light toward better understanding of the complex issues related with ROS generation at mitochondrial and cell levels.</p>

Insertion of one alanine to the neck region of FeS protein (+ 1Ala) creates a barrier for diffusion and shifts the equilibrium distribution of FeS positions toward cytochrome <italic>b</italic> subunit (see <xref rid="f0010" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>). This barrier is drastically raised by insertion of two alanines (+ 2Ala) which almost completely arrests the FeS domain at the Q<sub>o</sub> site. Horizontal rectangles depict the systematic increase in the density of FeS cluster at the Q<sub>o</sub> represented in grayscale: the darker and lighter shades denote higher and lower occupancy of the FeS cluster, respectively.</p>

        <p>Comparison of the distance-dependent impact of the spin-lattice relaxation of heme <italic>b</italic><sub>L</sub> on electron phase relaxation of the FeS cluster. The phase relaxation rates between 12 K and 26 K were measured for ascorbate-reduced samples containing wild type (<italic>circles</italic>), + 1Ala (<italic>squares</italic>) and + 2Ala (<italic>triangles</italic>) mutants. Solid lines represent a trend that was approximated by fitting the sum of third order polynomial and Lorentzian function. The amplitude of local maximum of the curves is proportional to the density of the FeS cluster at the Q<sub>o</sub> site <xref rid="bb0150" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref>.</p>

        <p>Model of superoxide generation by cytochrome <italic>bc</italic><sub>1</sub>. a, Ubiquinol (QH<sub>2</sub>) undergoes fast two-electron oxidation by oxidized FeS cluster and oxidized heme <italic>b</italic><sub>L</sub> (<italic>red arrows</italic> in the forward box). The long-lasting reduced state of heme <italic>b</italic><sub>L</sub> (when its reoxidation by heme <italic>b</italic><sub>H</sub> is impeded) allows for the single-electron reduction of quinone (Q) to semiquinone (SQ) (<italic>blue arrow</italic> in the semireverse box). This step is likely to be rate-limiting (denoted as a dotted frame of the box) and independent on the redox state and position of FeS cluster (grayed out dashed icon of FeS). Once SQ is formed (red hexagon with a dot) and the FeS head domain is at the Q<sub>o</sub> site the reaction of SQ<sub>o</sub> with molecular oxygen is out competed by either rapid oxidation of SQ<sub>o</sub> by oxidized FeS cluster (<italic>blue arrow</italic> in the short circuit — SOD insensitive box) or rapid reduction of SQ<sub>o</sub> to QH<sub>2</sub> by reduced FeS cluster (<italic>blue arrow</italic> in the completion of reverse reaction — SOD insensitive box). When FeS is out of the Q<sub>o</sub> site at the time of SQ<sub>o</sub> formation, oxygen can react with SQ<sub>o</sub> and superoxide is formed (<italic>brown arrow</italic> in the superoxide production — SOD-sensitive box). Each of these reactions brings the enzyme to the state with oxidized heme <italic>b</italic><sub>L</sub> and oxidized FeS cluster and the cycle can be repeated. Color code of cofactors: red, reduced; black, oxidized. b, Quantitative analysis of the model presented in (a) requires the assumption that increasing the distance of FeS cluster from Q<sub>o</sub> site decreases the electron transfer rates (<italic>k</italic><sub><italic>ET</italic></sub> FeS − Q<sub>o</sub>) between the FeS cluster and Q/SQ<sub>o</sub>/QH<sub>2</sub> (<italic>blue line</italic>) but increases electron exchange rates (<italic>k</italic><sub>ET</sub> FeS − <italic>c</italic><sub>1</sub>) with heme <italic>c</italic><sub>1</sub> (<italic>red line</italic>). In the simulations this assumption was approximated by dividing the FeS trajectory into 3 regions: 1 — FeS exchanges electrons only with the Q<sub>o</sub> site occupant, 2 — FeS cannot exchange electrons, and 3 — FeS exchanges electrons only with heme <italic>c</italic><sub>1</sub>. c, Simulated curves of steady-state reduction of cytochrome <italic>c</italic>, obtained from modeling of the <italic>semireverse</italic> mechanism as depicted in (a) and (b). In all forms, there is no SOD-sensitive cytochrome <italic>c</italic> reduction in the absence of antimycin (no Ant). In the presence of antimycin the simulated traces with (SOD) and without SOD (no SOD) diverge and percent of superoxide production can be calculated. d, Comparison of the experimentally obtained values (experiment) with those obtained from modeling <italic>semireverse</italic> or <italic>semiforward</italic> mechanisms (semireverse or semiforward, respectively). Color code of cofactors same as in (a).</p>
