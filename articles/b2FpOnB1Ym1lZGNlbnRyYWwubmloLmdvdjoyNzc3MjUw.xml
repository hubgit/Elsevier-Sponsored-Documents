        <title>Summary</title>
        <p>Inferior olive neurons regulate plasticity and timing in the cerebellar cortex via the climbing fiber pathway, but direct characterization of the output of this nucleus has remained elusive. We show that single somatic action potentials in olivary neurons are translated into a burst of axonal spikes. The number of spikes in the burst depends on the phase of subthreshold oscillations and, therefore, encodes the state of the olivary network. These bursts can be successfully transmitted to the cerebellar cortex in vivo, having a significant impact on Purkinje cells. They enhance dendritic spikes, modulate the complex spike pattern, and promote short-term and long-term plasticity at parallel fiber synapses in a manner dependent on the number of spikes in the burst. Our results challenge the view that the climbing fiber conveys an all-or-none signal to the cerebellar cortex and help to link learning and timing theories of olivocerebellar function.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>The climbing fibers are formed by the axons of the neurons in the inferior olive and are a major route for sensory information flow into the cerebellar cortex. It is therefore crucial to understand what information is conveyed by the climbing fibers and how it influences cerebellar processing. There are two major theories of climbing fiber function. According to one view, subthreshold membrane potential oscillations, which are synchronized across olivary neurons by gap junctions (<xref rid="bib36 bib37 bib46 bib44" ref-type="bibr">Lampl and Yarom, 1993, 1997; Llinas et al., 1974; Llinas and Yarom, 1986</xref>), provide a timing signal regulating the output of the downstream Purkinje cells (<xref rid="bib60 bib62" ref-type="bibr">Welsh et al., 1995; Yarom and Cohen, 2002</xref>). An alternative view proposes that the climbing fiber is involved in motor learning in the cerebellar cortex, acting as an error signal to trigger associative synaptic plasticity at parallel fiber synapses (<xref rid="bib1 bib27 bib50" ref-type="bibr">Albus, 1971; Ito, 2001; Marr, 1969</xref>). While these two views are not mutually exclusive, it has proven difficult to integrate them (<xref rid="bib52" ref-type="bibr">Mauk et al., 2000</xref>).</p>
      <p>To resolve this debate, we need a better understanding of how somatodendritic signals in olivary neurons are converted into spiking patterns in olivary axons and how this is related to the state of the olivary network. Furthermore, it is also necessary to understand the effect of different patterns of axonal spiking on the downstream Purkinje cells. Olivary neurons have a remarkable electrophysiological signature. They exhibit prominent subthreshold membrane potential oscillations driven by dendritic calcium conductances (<xref rid="bib36 bib37 bib44" ref-type="bibr">Lampl and Yarom, 1993, 1997; Llinas and Yarom, 1986</xref>). These oscillations are synchronized across neighboring neurons within the olivary network by gap junctions (<xref rid="bib19 bib40" ref-type="bibr">Devor and Yarom, 2002b; Leznik and Llinas, 2005</xref>), which can be uncoupled to generate dynamic cell assemblies (<xref rid="bib45 bib60" ref-type="bibr">Llinas and Sasaki, 1989; Welsh et al., 1995</xref>). When activated by depolarization or synaptic input, olivary neurons generate a characteristic response sequence (<xref rid="bib42 bib43" ref-type="bibr">Llinas and Yarom, 1981a, 1981b</xref>) consisting of an action potential immediately followed by a prolonged afterdepolarization (ADP) lasting up to 10 ms and terminated by a pronounced afterhyperpolarization (AHP). It is unclear how this sequence of events relates to patterns of output in the axon and, importantly, how the subthreshold oscillations affect this process. This is particularly important in light of the possibility that olivary axons may transmit bursts, which was originally proposed in the 1960s (<xref rid="bib2 bib13 bib20" ref-type="bibr">Armstrong and Rawson, 1979; Crill, 1970; Eccles et al., 1966</xref>) and has recently received renewed attention (<xref rid="bib51" ref-type="bibr">Maruta et al., 2007</xref>). To address these issues, we have made direct patch-clamp recordings from the axons of olivary neurons in rat brainstem slices, simultaneously with somatic patch-clamp recordings. Our findings provide direct evidence for axonal bursts and their modulation, leading to new insights into the information conveyed by the olivary axon about the state of the olivary network. We further demonstrate using a combination of in vitro and in vivo recordings from Purkinje cells that this information can be relayed to the cerebellar cortex, where it enhances Purkinje cell output and both short-term and long-term plasticity at parallel fiber synapses.</p>

        <title>Olivary Axons Generate Bursts</title>
        <p>Whole-cell somatic patch-clamp recordings were made from principal neurons in slices of the rat inferior olive under direct visual control. Principal neurons were identified by their large somata and characteristic electrophysiological properties (in particular the presence of a spike-ADP-AHP sequence upon depolarization; <xref rid="bib13 bib46 bib42 bib43" ref-type="bibr">Crill, 1970; Llinas et al., 1974; Llinas and Yarom, 1981a, 1981b</xref>), confirmed by biocytin staining (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>A). Axons were visualized by filling neurons via the patch pipette with Alexa Fluor 488, and simultaneous cell-attached axonal recordings were made from the cut ends of the axons using a second patch pipette at distances of up to 275 μm from the soma (n = 32).</p>
        <p>Action potentials triggered by depolarizing current pulses (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>B) or by single EPSPs evoked by white matter stimulation (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>C) were followed by a pronounced “shoulder,” or afterdepolarization (ADP), on which was superimposed one to six small (&lt;10 mV) wavelets at high frequency. Our simultaneous axonal recordings revealed that each wavelet corresponded to a spike in the axon with amplitude and kinetics comparable (and often identical) to the axonal counterpart of the primary sodium action potential. Thus, an action potential triggered by depolarizing current or a single synaptic stimulus was associated with a burst of axonal spikes (on average 2.2 ± 0.16 spikes, range 1–6 spikes, at an instantaneous frequency of 273 ± 9 Hz, range 127–476 Hz; n = 23 cells). In contrast, a rebound action potential triggered following the termination of hyperpolarizing current pulses lacked the pronounced ADP and was only associated with a single axonal spike (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>D). Subthreshold low-threshold calcium spikes and oscillations (<xref rid="bib42" ref-type="bibr">Llinas and Yarom, 1981a</xref>) on their own were not associated with axonal spikes. These findings demonstrate that the characteristic ADP of olivary neurons is converted into a spike burst in the axon and that the wavelets superimposed on the ADP correspond to axonal spikes.</p>

        <title>Bursts Are Initiated in the Olivary Axons</title>
        <p>To determine the site of origin of the bursts in the olivary axons, we examined our simultaneous somatic whole-cell recordings and axonal cell-attached recordings, with axonal morphology determined by subsequent biocytin processing and reconstruction. We found that the number of axonal spikes depended on the length of the axon spared by the slicing procedure. When axon length was shorter than 50 μm, most cells did not exhibit any secondary spikes or corresponding wavelets in the somatic ADP, despite the primary action potential being clearly present both at the soma and in the axon (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>A; n = 6/8 cells). Only with an axon length of at least 100 μm were multiple spikes consistently observed in the axon, with a saturating relationship between axon length and maximum number of axonal spikes (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>B; half maximum at 67 μm). A comparable relationship was observed for the mean number of axonal spikes (see <xref rid="app2" ref-type="sec">Figure S1</xref> available online). Similarly, the amplitude of the secondary spikes relative to the primary spike depended on the length of axon (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>C; half maximum at 53 μm), with the amplitude of primary and secondary spikes becoming comparable at axon lengths of at least 100 μm (statistically indistinguishable results were obtained with spikes triggered by current injection and synaptic stimulation; data not shown, p &gt; 0.05). In contrast, the somatic input resistance did not depend on the length of the axon (mean 97 ± 7.5 MΩ; <italic>r</italic> = −0.088, p &gt; 0.05). Taken together, these findings suggest that the secondary spikelets in the axon, corresponding to the wavelets in the ADP, are initiated in the axon. To confirm this, we estimated the latency between the axonal and somatic spikes, by measuring the time between the peak of the axonal spike and the peak of the dV/dt of the somatic action potential (<xref rid="app2" ref-type="sec">Figure S2</xref>; <xref rid="bib11 bib53" ref-type="bibr">Clark et al., 2005; Meeks and Mennerick, 2007</xref>). We found that for both the primary and secondary spikes, the axonal spike clearly preceded the somatic spike for most axonal recording sites less than 100 μm from the soma (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>D), indicating that spikes are initiated in the axon relatively close to the soma.</p>
      </sec>
      <sec id="sec2.3">
        <title>Whole-Cell Recordings from Olivary Axons</title>
        <p>We succeeded in making simultaneous whole-cell recordings from the soma and cut end of the axon of the same neuron when the axon was cut within 60 μm of the soma, the approximate distance at which myelin normally begins to ensheath the olivary neuron axons (<xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr">de Zeeuw et al., 1990</xref>). While these axons did not usually exhibit secondary spikes, consistent with the results shown above (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>B), these recordings nevertheless allowed us to investigate initiation and propagation of subthreshold and suprathreshold potentials in the axon. The primary spike was consistently larger in the axon than at the soma and occurred first at the axonal recording site (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>B; n = 5), in agreement with an axonal initiation site. In contrast, the ADP was larger at the soma and strongly attenuated in the axon. The AHP was also larger at the soma but suffered much less attenuation in the axon than the ADP (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figures 3</xref>B and 3D). Spontaneous subthreshold oscillations (STO), a hallmark of olivary neurons (<xref rid="bib10 bib33 bib44" ref-type="bibr">Chorev et al., 2007; Khosrovani et al., 2007; Llinas and Yarom, 1986</xref>), were larger at the soma but showed little attenuation in the axon (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figures 3</xref>C and 3D), probably due to their low frequency (1–10 Hz). These findings indicate that, while spikes are initiated in the axon, the ADP, the AHP and the subthreshold oscillations most likely originate from the somatodendritic region.</p>

      <sec id="sec2.4">
        <title>Phase Dependence of Olivary Bursts during Subthreshold Oscillations</title>
        <p>The subthreshold membrane potential oscillations exhibited by olivary neurons range from 1 to 10 Hz in frequency and from 1 to 20 mV in amplitude (<xref rid="bib10 bib33 bib44" ref-type="bibr">Chorev et al., 2007; Khosrovani et al., 2007; Llinas and Yarom, 1986</xref>). To determine if oscillations can modulate synaptically triggered axonal bursts, we mimicked subthreshold oscillations by injecting a sinusoidal current into the soma, with a frequency of 5 Hz and producing a mean peak-to-peak amplitude of 9.6 ± 0.6 mV. Spikes were initiated by EPSPs activated by synaptic stimulation timed at different phases of the oscillation (n = 14 cells). The number of spikes in the axonal burst was modulated in phase with the oscillation (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>B). For the example shown in <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>A, the mean number of spikes triggered by synaptic stimulation in the absence of oscillations was 2.07 ± 0.03, with a low coefficient of variation (CV) of 0.17. During oscillations, synaptic input triggered from zero to three spikes (mean 2.40 ± 0.17, coefficient of variation 0.49), with the number of spikes depending on the timing of the EPSP relative to oscillatory phase. This indicates that the phase of the oscillation can regulate the output of olivary neurons.</p>
        <p>In olivary neurons that exhibited spontaneous oscillations (<xref rid="app2" ref-type="sec">Figure S3</xref>), we investigated whether the spike output was affected by the phase of the oscillation. The mean oscillation frequency was 5.6 ± 0.65 Hz (n = 7) and the peak-to-peak amplitude was 6.6 ± 0.94 mV. Because synaptic stimulation abolishes oscillations in olivary slice preparations (<xref rid="bib36" ref-type="bibr">Lampl and Yarom, 1993</xref>), we injected short current pulses (2 ms; 300–1800 pA) at different phases of the oscillation (<xref rid="app2" ref-type="sec">Figure S3</xref>B) to trigger spikes and characterized the axonal spike output by counting the number of wavelets on the ADP. Confirming our results with injected oscillations, we found that the spike output varied with the phase of the oscillation (<xref rid="app2" ref-type="sec">Figure S3</xref>C).</p>

        <title>Reliability and Precision of Axonal Transmission of Bursts</title>
        <p>A 1:1 relationship was typically observed between wavelets on the somatic ADP and axonal spikes. However, in the majority of axonal recordings made at &gt;125 μm from the soma (7/10 cells), occasional failures of propagation of secondary spikes were observed (i.e., cases where a somatic wavelet did not coincide with a detectable spike at the axonal recording site; <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref>A). This probably occurred due to failure of orthodromic propagation of spikes initiated in the more proximal axon. Intriguingly, all axonal spikes always had a somatic counterpart, indicating that propagation of the axonally generated spike back to the soma always results in a wavelet. We next quantified the reliability of propagation of individual spikes within the burst. Propagation of the primary spike was 100% reliable. Spikes in the middle of the burst—i.e., the third and fourth spike—were most susceptible to propagation failure. The second, third, fourth, and fifth spikes in the burst exhibited propagation probabilities of 0.85 ± 0.03, 0.82 ± 0.04, and 0.66 ± 0.09, and 0.89 ± 0.10, respectively (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref>B), indicating that propagation is relatively reliable—despite occasional failures—across the burst.</p>
        <p>In addition to the relatively reliable axonal propagation of spikes, the timing of individual spikes within the burst was remarkably consistent from trial to trial. As shown in <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref>C, the interspike interval between the first and second spikes in a burst was highly reliable, with a CV of only 0.12 ± 0.02 (n = 23 cells). The succeeding intervals were similarly reliable (second interval CV: 0.20 ± 0.03; third interval CV: 0.18 ± 0.06). The first ISI in the burst was 3.98 ± 0.19 ms for a two-burst and 3.53 ± 0.51 for a three-burst. These findings indicate that the timing of spikes within a burst in the olivary axon is highly stereotyped (assured in part by reliable transmission of each spike), with only the number of spikes varying.</p>

        <title>Transmission of Axonal Bursts In Vivo</title>
        <p>Can bursts of action potentials in the axons of the inferior olive neurons be faithfully propagated to their downstream targets, the Purkinje cells in the cerebellar cortex, under physiological conditions? To address this question, we recorded climbing fiber excitatory postsynaptic currents (CF EPSCs) (<xref rid="bib35 bib41 bib55" ref-type="bibr">Konnerth et al., 1990; Llano et al., 1991; Perkel et al., 1990</xref>) from Purkinje cells in vivo (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6</xref>A). Given that the axonal bursts in olivary neurons have highly reproducible timing (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref>), if they are reliably transmitted to their synapses with Purkinje cells, then bursts of CF EPSCs with similar intervals and timing to the axonal bursts should be observed. To optimize the recording of CF EPSCs, we used an internal solution containing QX314 and held Purkinje cells at hyperpolarized potentials (−70 mV to −100 mV) in order to prevent unclamped spikes and regenerative responses (<xref rid="bib41" ref-type="bibr">Llano et al., 1991</xref>).</p>
        <p>CF EPSCs were identified based on their characteristic large-amplitude and all-or-none nature (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6</xref>B), as reported in vitro (<xref rid="bib35 bib41 bib55" ref-type="bibr">Konnerth et al., 1990; Llano et al., 1991; Perkel et al., 1990</xref>). CF EPSCs had a relatively low mean frequency (on average 0.63 ± 0.03 Hz; range: 0.24–1.85 Hz), comparable to the rate of spontaneous complex spikes recorded in vivo (<xref rid="bib2 bib38 bib47" ref-type="bibr">Armstrong and Rawson, 1979; Lang et al., 1999; Loewenstein et al., 2005</xref>). In approximately half of the Purkinje cells recorded (n = 16/33), the initial CF EPSC was followed by one or more additional EPSCs in a burst-like pattern (at 222 ± 46 Hz; range: 91–357 Hz; first ISI: 4.07 ± 0.094 ms, second ISI: 4.17 ± 0.19 ms); bursts comprised up to four individual CF EPSCs in some Purkinje cells (<xref rid="app2" ref-type="sec">Figure S4</xref>). The frequency of occurrence of bursts in a given Purkinje cell was voltage independent when varying holding potential between −70 mV and −90 mV (n = 6; p = 0.67), confirming their presynaptic origin. By overlaying multiple spontaneous CF EPSC bursts from the same cell, the timing of individual EPSCs within the burst was observed to be very reproducible (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figures 6</xref>C and <xref rid="app2" ref-type="sec">S4</xref>). In particular, the timing of the second EPSC in the burst was highly precise (CV = 0.18 ± 0.05; n = 16 cells), very similar to the timing of the second spike in a burst in an olivary axon (cf. <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref>C; p &gt; 0.1), confirming that the axonal burst in olivary neurons can be reliably and precisely transmitted to Purkinje cells. The frequency of double- and triple-peak CF EPSCs was 15.9% ± 1.6% (range: 0.1%–80%; n = 16) and 4.2% ± 0.6% (range: 0%–35%; n = 6), respectively. Remarkably, in some cells we were able to observe the putative postsynaptic counterpart of the occasional failures of spike propagation observed in our axonal recordings (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref>). In these rare cases, the second EPSC occurred at precisely the time of the third EPSC in a burst (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6</xref>C), suggesting that the second spike in an olivary burst failed to be transmitted. These findings demonstrate that olivary bursts are transmitted via the climbing fibers to their target Purkinje cells in the cerebellar cortex in vivo and that occasional failures of spike transmission can be observed.</p>

        <title>Climbing Fiber Bursts Shape the Complex Spike Response in Purkinje Cells</title>
        <p>To investigate the consequences of bursts in climbing fiber axons for postsynaptic Purkinje cells, we recorded from the soma, and in some cases, simultaneously from the dendrites, of Purkinje cells in slices during CF stimulation. Bursts of one to seven CF stimuli were delivered at interstimulus intervals of 2 or 3 ms (a range representative of interspike intervals recorded in olivary axons during bursts), or as “physiological” spike patterns recorded from olivary axons in slices. The number of dendritic spikes triggered by CF stimulation was related to the number of stimulations in a CF burst, with larger numbers of CF stimuli triggering additional dendritic spikes (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figures 7</xref>B and 7C). At the soma, the number of spikes in the somatic complex spike was dependent on the number of stimuli in the CF burst: there was a linear relationship between the number of CF stimuli and the number of somatic spikelets (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figures 7</xref>B and 7D). The duration of the complex spike was also linearly dependent on the number of CF stimuli across a range of interstimulus intervals (<xref rid="app2" ref-type="sec">Figures S5</xref>A and S5B); at longer interstimulus intervals, CF bursts were more effective at triggering extra somatic spikes and produced a more prolonged complex spike. In summary, these results indicate that the number of spikes within the presynaptic CF burst can influence the number of spikes and duration of the resulting complex spike.</p>
        <p>The effect of additional CF input also changed the pattern and timing of spikes within the complex spike. Rather than triggering a new somatic spike at a specific synaptic delay, an additional CF stimulus slightly advanced spikes within the ongoing complex spike, with the additional somatic spikes caused by bursty CF input appearing on the tail end of the complex spike. The first spike to be affected by an additional CF stimulus was advanced by 0.41 ± 0.11 ms (2 ms interstimulus interval) and 0.26 ± 0.11 ms (3 ms interstimulus interval) and was increased in precision; the SD of timing decreasing by 0.23 ± 0.12 ms and 0.11 ± 0.04 ms (2 and 3 ms interstimulus interval, respectively; <xref rid="app2" ref-type="sec">Figures S5</xref>C and S5D).</p>
        <p>Since somatic spikelets in the complex spike propagate relatively poorly down the Purkinje cell axon, we used spikelet height and interspikelet interval to predict which spikes would be successfully propagated down the axon (<xref rid="bib54" ref-type="bibr">Monsivais et al., 2005</xref>; see also <xref rid="bib32" ref-type="bibr">Khaliq and Raman, 2005</xref>). The predicted number of axonal spikes versus the number of CF stimuli, using physiological input patterns, was very close to the unity line (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7</xref>E), producing a “one in, one out” input-output relationship for axonal CF spikes and Purkinje cell output spikes. Finally, we examined the relationship between the CF burst and the pause in firing following the complex spike. To a first approximation, increasing the number of spikes in the CF burst decreased the length of the post-complex spike pause, as expected from the stronger excitation at the soma. However, when further burst stimulation succeeded in evoking an additional dendritic calcium spike (e.g., lowest panel of <xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7</xref>B), the duration of the pause increased (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7</xref>F), presumably because the dendritic spike in turn lengthens the post-complex spike pause (<xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr">Davie et al., 2008</xref>). In summary, bursts of CF input can be encoded by the firing patterns of the postsynaptic Purkinje neurons, both in terms of dendritic spikes and axonal output.</p>

        <title>Enhancement of Long-Term Depression by Climbing Fiber Bursts</title>
        <p>Given that CF bursts can regulate the number of dendritic spikes produced by CF input (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7</xref>), we examined the consequences for short-term and long-term plasticity in Purkinje cells. Parallel fiber (PF) synapses are known to undergo long-term depression (LTD) when stimulated in conjunction with CF input (<xref rid="bib27 bib59" ref-type="bibr">Ito, 2001; Wang et al., 2000</xref>). We therefore investigated whether the CF bursts had an effect on the induction of PF LTD. We used an induction protocol which paired five PF stimuli (at 100 Hz; (<xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr">Chadderton et al., 2004</xref>) with either a single CF stimulus or a CF burst (five stimuli at 400 Hz; <xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Figure 8</xref>A). We used only a small number of pairings (25) delivered every 2 s, which should normally provide only a relatively weak stimulus for plasticity (<xref rid="bib29" ref-type="bibr">Jorntell and Hansel, 2006</xref>). Indeed, the induction protocol with a single CF stimulus produced potentiation in the control group (139% ± 20% compared to baseline; n = 10; p = 0.033). In contrast, when a single CF stimulus was replaced by a CF burst in the induction protocol, robust LTD was observed (63% ± 15% compared to baseline; n = 9; p &lt; 0.01; <xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Figures 8</xref>B–8D). These results demonstrate that CF bursts can enhance the probability of LTD induction using conjunctive PF-CF stimulation.</p>

        <title>Enhancement of Synaptically Evoked Suppression of Excitatory Synapses by Climbing Fiber Bursts</title>
        <p>Pairing a short burst of PF stimuli with CF input can transiently and selectively depress the PF synapses, a form of associative short-term plasticity known as synaptically evoked suppression of excitatory synapses (SSE; <xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">Brenowitz and Regehr, 2005</xref>). We tested whether CF bursts could enhance SSE. For induction of SSE, we used a burst of four to six PF stimuli at 100 Hz followed by either a single CF stimulus or a burst of three or five CF stimuli at 400 Hz. When the CF stimulus was omitted, there was no change in synaptic efficacy at the PF synapses (2.5% ± 3% depression relative to baseline; n = 18 trials from 3 cells). When PF inputs were paired with a single CF stimulus, PF synapses were depressed by 12% ± 2.6% (n = 17 trials). When the PF stimulus was paired with a burst of three or five CF stimuli, the PF synapses were depressed by 23% ± 7% and 50% ± 2.4% (n = 17 trials), respectively. There was a significant correlation (<italic>r</italic> = 0.61, p &lt; 0.001) between the number of CF stimuli in the induction protocol and the degree of PF depression (<xref rid="fig9" ref-type="fig">Figure 9</xref>). Together with the previous results, we conclude that CF bursts, driven by bursts in olivary axons, can enhance both short-term and long-term synaptic plasticity in postsynaptic Purkinje cells.</p>

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>We have made direct recordings from the axons of inferior olive neurons, which form the climbing fibers of the cerebellum. We demonstrate that olivary axons can fire high-frequency bursts of action potentials that can be modulated by olivary oscillations and that are transmitted to the cerebellar cortex. This challenges the view of the climbing fiber as a low-frequency all-or-none signaling pathway. We further show that climbing fiber bursts have a dramatic effect on their postsynaptic targets, the Purkinje cells: they enhance dendritic spiking, modulate complex spike signaling, and promote short-term and long-term plasticity in cerebellar Purkinje cells in a manner that depends on the number of spikes in the input burst. Thus, bursts in axons of olivary neurons influence both short-term processing and memory storage in Purkinje cells. Our findings therefore provide a rich new perspective on the functional role of the climbing fiber system.</p>

        <title>Bursts in Olivary Axons</title>
        <p>Our findings provide direct evidence that olivary axons can fire high-frequency, stereotyped bursts of action potentials in response to single synaptic potentials. Furthermore, we show that these bursts are transmitted to Purkinje cells in vivo via the climbing fibers. There has been previous indirect evidence that olivary axons may fire in bursts. Wavelets on the ADP of olivary neurons were observed in early intracellular recordings from the somata of olivary neurons both in vivo and in vitro, with impulse collision experiments suggesting that wavelets can propagate along the climbing fiber (<xref rid="bib3 bib13" ref-type="bibr">Armstrong et al., 1968; Crill, 1970</xref>). Furthermore, several studies using sharp electrode recordings from Purkinje cells in vivo reported spontaneous trains of large EPSP-like events, which have been interpreted to arise from bursts in climbing fiber axons (<xref rid="bib2 bib20 bib51" ref-type="bibr">Armstrong and Rawson, 1979; Eccles et al., 1966; Maruta et al., 2007</xref>). Our direct recordings of bursts in olivary axons, and our demonstration of their functional significance, should now confirm them as an important element in the operation of the olivocerebellar circuit.</p>

        <title>A Model of Spike Generation by Olivary Neurons</title>
        <p>Our simultaneous axonal and somatic recordings provide new insights into the generation of the characteristic electrophysiological signature of olivary neurons. First, our results provide direct evidence that both the primary sodium spike and the secondary spikes originate in the olivary axon. Second, we demonstrate that the prominent subthreshold oscillations are smaller in the axon than at the soma, consistent with the idea that they originate in the dendrites and that the gap junctional coupling that transmits the oscillation between multiple olivary neurons is predominantly dendritic (<xref rid="bib4 bib44" ref-type="bibr">Bal and McCormick, 1997; Llinas and Yarom, 1986</xref>). Finally, we show that the pronounced ADP is markedly attenuated in the axon, consistent with the hypothesis that the ADP is generated by high-voltage-activated calcium channels localized in the dendrites (<xref rid="bib43" ref-type="bibr">Llinas and Yarom, 1981b</xref>).</p>
        <p>Together, these results suggest a mechanism for burst generation in olivary neurons: the initial sodium action potential is initiated in the axon and backpropagates into the dendrites, activating the calcium channels that underlie the ADP. When the ADP reaches the soma, the plateau potential is close to 0 mV, a value at which somatic sodium channels will be mostly inactivated. We have demonstrated that the ADP is rapidly attenuated in the axon, such that when it reaches the action potential initiation site in the axon it provides sufficient depolarization to trigger repetitive axonal spikes, but insufficient depolarization to inactivate sodium channels. These spikes in turn propagate down the axon at the same time as backpropagating toward the soma, giving rise to small wavelets due to inactivation of the local sodium channels by the ADP. This picture can be compared to burst generation in cortical pyramidal neurons, where the backpropagation of the action potential into the dendrites activates calcium conductances that provide depolarization to the axon to generate bursting (<xref rid="bib61" ref-type="bibr">Williams and Stuart, 1999</xref>). In contrast, in the olivary neurons, the ADP is large enough at the soma to inactivate somatic sodium channels to such a degree that full-amplitude spikes do not appear during the ADP, instead being replaced by small wavelets.</p>

        <title>Bursts Encode Oscillations</title>
        <p>The prominent subthreshold oscillations in olivary neurons have been proposed to determine the timing of olivary output (<xref rid="bib36" ref-type="bibr">Lampl and Yarom, 1993</xref>), but little attention has been paid to how the phase of the oscillation affects somatodendritic integration. By providing synaptic input at different times relative to subthreshold oscillations, we demonstrate that the number of spikes in the olivary burst depends on the phase of the oscillation. This is presumably due to differential availability or activation of dendritic calcium channels at different time points in the oscillation, which in turn sets the duration of the ADP and thus the number of spikes in the axonal burst (see above). In contrast, <xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr">Crill (1970)</xref> has shown that the number of spikes in the response varies little with the strength of stimulation. Thus, olivary bursts provide a means of encoding the state of the olivary network in a more fine-grained manner than possible by a single all-or-none spike, but do not seem to convey information about the intensity of stimulus that triggered them.</p>

        <title>Transmission of Spikes by Olivary Axons</title>
        <p>We have employed a dual strategy for investigating the transmission of bursts by olivary axons. First, we have made simultaneous somatic and axonal recordings in olivary slices. These recordings reveal that the transmission of olivary bursts down the axon is relatively reliable, with the entire burst normally being successfully transmitted. However, individual spikes in the olivary burst can fail with low probability. Second, in a complementary approach, we have made voltage-clamp recordings of climbing fiber EPSCs from Purkinje cells in vivo, which reveal that they can occur as bursts. These bursts are highly stereotyped, with interspike interval precision corresponding to that observed in olivary axons. This confirms that olivary bursts are transmitted along the full extent of the climbing fiber axons and successfully and reliably activate the downstream Purkinje cell targets. The fact that occasionally “skipped” EPSCs were observed in these recordings confirms that the occasional failures of axonal propagation observed in olivary slices also occur in vivo, and suggests that some modulation of axonal transmission may be possible. This overall picture contrasts with that observed in Purkinje cell axons, where propagation of complex spike bursts, which are of a similar frequency, is far less reliable (<xref rid="bib32 bib54" ref-type="bibr">Khaliq and Raman, 2005; Monsivais et al., 2005</xref>). This strengthens the possibility that olivary bursts have functional significance and suggests that, compared to Purkinje cell axons, they express different types or densities of voltage-gated channels in order to improve the reliability of high-frequency axonal transmission.</p>

        <title>Impact of Olivary Axon Bursts on Purkinje Cell Dendritic Integration and Spike Output</title>
        <p>For olivary bursts to have functional consequences, the postsynaptic partners of olivary neurons must be able to read out and modify their output based on the characteristics of the bursts. We have addressed this issue by making simultaneous somatic and dendritic recordings from Purkinje cells and activating the climbing fiber in different patterns. We demonstrate that bursts in the climbing fiber can promote generation of dendritic spikes in Purkinje cells. Furthermore, climbing fiber bursts can modify the number of spikelets in the complex spike and its duration, with both reflecting the number of spikes in the presynaptic burst. The resulting wide range of complex spike waveforms is consistent with the variability in complex spike patterns recorded in vivo at the somatic (<xref rid="bib2 bib8 bib25 bib49" ref-type="bibr">Armstrong and Rawson, 1979; Campbell and Hesslow, 1986b; Gilbert, 1976; Mano, 1970</xref>) and axonal (<xref rid="bib7 bib28" ref-type="bibr">Campbell and Hesslow, 1986a; Ito and Simpson, 1971</xref>) level. Finally, we demonstrate that the pause in simple spiking following the complex spike (<xref rid="bib2 bib5 bib14 bib39 bib57" ref-type="bibr">Armstrong and Rawson, 1979; Bloedel and Roberts, 1971; Davie et al., 2008; Latham and Paul, 1970; Sato et al., 1992</xref>) also sensitively reflects both the number of spikes in the climbing fiber burst and its effect on dendritic activity. Thus, these results indicate that Purkinje cells can provide both dendritic and axosomatic readout of olivary activity. Using a model of axonal transmission of the complex spike (<xref rid="bib54" ref-type="bibr">Monsivais et al., 2005</xref>; see also <xref rid="bib32" ref-type="bibr">Khaliq and Raman, 2005</xref>), we predict that many of the additional spikelets in the somatic complex spike will be transmitted by the Purkinje cell axon, indicating that olivary bursts can drastically alter the output of the cerebellar cortex. The next step will be to determine how these changes in output are interpreted by the downstream synapses with the neurons of the deep cerebellar nuclei (<xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr">De Zeeuw et al., 1997</xref>), which also receive input from climbing fiber collaterals and are thus also subject to the impact of climbing fiber bursts.</p>

        <title>Olivary Bursts Enhance Synaptic Plasticity in Purkinje Cells</title>
        <p>Climbing fibers are known to play an important role in triggering plasticity in Purkinje cells (<xref rid="bib27" ref-type="bibr">Ito, 2001</xref>). Our results indicate that bursts in the climbing fiber provide an enhanced stimulus for the induction of both associative short-term and long-term plasticity at parallel fiber synapses. This calls into question one of the fundamental assumptions of research into cerebellar plasticity, namely that the climbing fiber functions as an all-or-none trigger for associative plasticity. Rather, the sign and degree of plasticity is graded depending on the number of spikes in the climbing fiber burst, which in turn reflects the oscillatory state of the olive. This presumably in part reflects different levels of postsynaptic dendritic Ca<sup>2+</sup> produced by different numbers of climbing fiber stimuli (<xref rid="bib6 bib12 bib59" ref-type="bibr">Brenowitz and Regehr, 2005; Coesmans et al., 2004; Wang et al., 2000</xref>). While a few studies have used repetitive stimulation of climbing fibers for plasticity induction (<xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">Brenowitz and Regehr, 2005</xref>), none have explored the physiological range of climbing fiber burst frequencies shown here. Our findings indicate that, in order to understand physiological synaptic plasticity, burst stimulation of the climbing fiber should be considered when designing induction protocols for plasticity experiments. Furthermore, it will be important to investigate the impact of burst patterns for other kinds of plasticity involving the climbing fiber, such as CF LTD (<xref rid="bib26" ref-type="bibr">Hansel and Linden, 2000</xref>).</p>

        <title>Implications for Cerebellar Function</title>
        <p>There has been considerable controversy regarding whether the climbing fiber conveys a timing signal or an error signal that drives plasticity (<xref rid="bib52" ref-type="bibr">Mauk et al., 2000</xref>). Subthreshold oscillations have been shown to play a crucial role in gating the response of olivary neurons to synaptic input, such that during the crest of an oscillation, the neuron is closer to threshold and hence a small stimulus will be more likely to cause spike output than at the trough of the cycle (<xref rid="bib36 bib44" ref-type="bibr">Lampl and Yarom, 1993; Llinas and Yarom, 1986</xref>). This supports the idea that oscillations can act to synchronize olivary output (<xref rid="bib17 bib48 bib60 bib62" ref-type="bibr">Devor, 2002; Long et al., 2002; Welsh et al., 1995; Yarom and Cohen, 2002</xref>). However, in vivo recordings indicate that the inferior olive can respond at very low thresholds with high probability and short latency to sensory stimulation (<xref rid="bib24 bib23" ref-type="bibr">Gellman et al., 1985; Gellman et al., 1983</xref>) and that olivary neurons can fire at various times relative to the phase of the oscillation (<xref rid="bib33" ref-type="bibr">Khosrovani et al., 2007</xref>). Furthermore, recordings of complex spike activity from Purkinje cells in vivo indicate that olivary spiking is at most weakly periodic (<xref rid="bib10 bib30 bib31 bib38" ref-type="bibr">Chorev et al., 2007; Keating and Thach, 1995, 1997; Lang et al., 1999</xref>). Together these findings suggest that olivary spikes are not necessarily restricted to a specific phase of the oscillation, challenging the view that subthreshold oscillations are strict determinants of olivary timing.</p>
        <p>We have shown that olivary neurons do not generate a unitary, all-or-none spike output. Rather, axonal output is in the form of a burst, with the number of spikes in the burst being graded, depending on the phase of the oscillation. This mechanism therefore allows olivary axons to convey information about the timing of the spike relative to the phase of the oscillation, even when the spike occurs out of phase. Thus, rather than serving to precisely time and synchronize olivary spikes (direct triggering of spikes via strong gap junctional coupling would provide a better candidate for a precise synchronization mechanism; see <xref rid="bib18 bib48" ref-type="bibr">Devor and Yarom, 2002a; Long et al., 2002</xref>), subthreshold oscillations may function as a time-keeping device, assigning more saliency to in-phase stimuli. Thus, bursts in olivary axons serve to amplify any phase-dependence of olivary spiking in response to input, maximizing the signal-to-noise of in-phase transmission of information from the olive. These bursts are in turn read out by the downstream Purkinje cells, by enhancing dendritic spikes, axonal output, and synaptic plasticity. Our findings can therefore help to reconcile the competing theories of olivocerebellar function, in that olivary bursts provide a mechanism for oscillatory phase-dependent learning of parallel fiber input patterns in Purkinje cells, thereby linking the timing and learning aspects of motor function.</p>

Propagation of the spikelets in the somatic complex spike down the Purkinje cell axon was predicted using the separatrix function based on spikelet height and interspike interval described previously (<xref rid="bib54" ref-type="bibr">Monsivais et al., 2005</xref>). In Purkinje cell dendritic recordings, calcium spikes were identified by indentifying events with a steep rise in the voltage trace associated with a discontinuity (or “kink”) in the dendritic voltage, and a decay faster than the EPSP (<xref rid="bib21 bib22 bib56" ref-type="bibr">Edgerton and Reinhart, 2003; Gasparini et al., 2004; Rancz and Hausser, 2006</xref>).</p>

        <p>(B) Example dendritic (upper traces, recorded 85 μm from the soma) and somatic (lower traces) Purkinje cell responses to one, three, and five CF stimuli at 2 ms intervals (black triangles). Several superimposed traces (gray); single examples shown in blue (dendritic recording) and red (somatic recording). Dendritic and somatic data are shown with different timescales. Blue arrows, post-complex spike pause duration; asterisk, additional dendritic calcium spike.</p>
        <p>(C) Mean (±SEM) number of dendritic spikes (n = 3 cells) in response to CF burst stimulation. Stimuli were given at intervals of 2 ms (dark blue markers), 3 ms (green markers), or patterns mimicking recorded olivary axon bursts (light blue markers).</p>
        <p>(D) Mean (±SEM, n = 10) number of somatic spikes in response to CF burst stimulation, protocol as in (B). Red line marks unity, where Purkinje cell spike number is equal to number of CF stimuli.</p>
        <p>(E) Mean (±SEM, n = 7) number of CF burst-evoked spikes predicted to be propagated by the Purkinje cell axon (see <xref rid="sec4" ref-type="sec">Experimental Procedures</xref>). Stimulation protocol as in (B), red line as in (D).</p>
        <p>(F) Average (mean ± SEM) post-complex spike pause length following bursts of CF stimulation. Responses in which a burst of CF stimuli elicited additional dendritic spikes are averaged separately and marked with an asterisk.</p>
