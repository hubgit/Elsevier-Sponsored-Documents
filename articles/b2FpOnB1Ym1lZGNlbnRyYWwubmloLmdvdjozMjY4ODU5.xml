      <abstract>
        <p>ATP is actively released into the extracellular environment from a variety of cell types in response to mechanical stimuli. This is particularly true in bone where mechanically induced ATP release leads to immediate early gene activation to regulate bone remodelling; however there is no consensus as to which mechanical stimuli stimulate osteoblasts the most. To elucidate which specific type(s) of mechanical stimuli induce ATP release and gene activation in human osteoblasts, we performed an array of experiments using different mechanical stimuli applied to both monolayer and 3D cultures of the same osteoblast cell type, SaOS-2. ATP release from osteoblasts cultured in monolayer significantly increased in response to turbulent fluid flow, laminar fluid flow and substrate strain. No significant change in ATP release could be detected in 3D osteoblast cultures in response to cyclic or static compressive loading of osteoblast-seeded scaffolds, whilst turbulent fluid flow increased ATP release from 3D cultures of osteoblasts to a greater degree than observed in monolayer cultures. <italic>Cox-2</italic> expression quantified using real time PCR was significantly lower in cells subjected to turbulent fluid flow whereas c-<italic>fos</italic> expression was significantly higher in cells subjected to strain. Load-induced signalling via c-<italic>fos</italic> was further investigated using a SaOS-2 c-<italic>fos</italic> luciferase reporter cell line and increased in response to substrate strain and turbulent fluid flow in both monolayer and 3D, with no significant change in response to laminar fluid flow or 3D compressive loading. The results of this study demonstrate for the first time strain-induced ATP release from osteoblasts and that turbulent fluid flow in 3D up regulates the signals required for bone remodelling.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>Mechanical loading placed upon bone creates substrate deformation and movement of interstitial fluid to engender mechanical stimuli that include substrate strain, compressive loading and fluid flow-induced shear stress (<xref rid="bib7 bib13" ref-type="bibr">Ehrlich and Lanyon, 2002; Klein-Nulend et al., 2005</xref>). These mechanical stimuli are of interest as they may alter bone mineral density via adaptive remodelling (<xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">Frost, 1964</xref>) mediated by a combination of systemic factors such as parathyroid hormone (PTH) and localised signalling molecules including ATP (<xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">Bowler et al., 2001</xref>). <italic>In vitro</italic> studies have demonstrated that ATP release from human HOBIT osteoblastic cells is increased 4 fold in response to medium displacement (<xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr">Romanello et al., 2001</xref>) and 10 fold in murine MC3T3-E1 preosteoblasts in response to laminar fluid flow within a parallel flow chamber (<xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">Genetos et al., 2005</xref>). ATP release from osteoblasts in response to substrate strain has not previously been investigated despite evidence that it induces increased ATP release from other cell types (<xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr">Sauer et al., 2000</xref>).</p>
      <p>Once ATP has been released in response to mechanical stimuli it may act back upon P2 receptors and trigger downstream signalling cascades to activate immediate early genes (IEG) such as c-<italic>fos</italic> (<xref rid="bib25" ref-type="bibr">Wagstaff et al., 2000</xref>). The gene products c-Fos and c-Jun form the activator protein-1 (AP-1) complex which binds to the promoter regions of AP-1 recognition elements on genes important for osteogenic responses such as osteocalcin, alkaline phosphatase and collagen type I (<xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr">Angel and Karin, 1991</xref>). This makes c-<italic>fos</italic> a critical transcriptional mediator in bone, as demonstrated by the phenotype of the c-<italic>fos</italic><sup>−/−</sup> mice (<xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">Demiralp et al., 2002</xref>).</p>
      <p>There have been several studies linking mechanical stimulation and c-<italic>fos</italic> activation in osteoblasts albeit in different cell types and using different methods of mechanical stimulation: murine MC3T3-E1 pre-osteoblastic cells subjected to laminar fluid flow exhibited increased c-<italic>fos</italic> mRNA along with increased nuclear immunostaining of c-<italic>fos</italic> protein (<xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr">Pavalko et al., 1998</xref>), and substrate strain in combination with strain-induced fluid flow increased c-<italic>fos</italic> mRNA in MC3T3-E1 cells cultured on 3D porous collagen matrices (<xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr">Tanaka et al., 2005</xref>). In addition to c-<italic>fos</italic>, several other important IEG have been shown to be regulated in osteoblasts by mechanical stimuli: Cyclooxygenase-2 (<italic>Cox-2</italic>) transcription in MC3T3-E1 cells is increased in response to laminar fluid flow (<xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr">Wadhwa et al., 2002</xref>); Early growth response 2 (<italic>Egr-2</italic>) and c-<italic>jun</italic> are up regulated in response to equibiaxial, homogeneous tensile strain in MC3T3-E1 subclone 4 osteoblasts (<xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr">Ott et al., 2009</xref>).</p>
      <p>Understanding which types of mechanical loading in human osteoblasts lead to purinergic signalling and the activation of key osteogenic genes is fundamental to bone tissue engineering. Therefore, given the disparity in species, cell types, loading mechanisms and gene products measured in the research on the effects of mechanical loading in osteoblasts, we undertook the current study to determine changes in ATP release and IEG expression in response to turbulent fluid flow, laminar fluid flow, substrate strain and 3D compressive loading in the same cell type, human SaOS-2 osteoblastic cells.</p>

        <p>SaOS-2 cultures were maintained as previously described (<xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">Bowler et al., 2001</xref>) (see also online <xref rid="s0115" ref-type="sec">supplementary material</xref>). Cells were plated at 5×10<sup>4</sup> per well in 24 well plates, 1×10<sup>5</sup> per slide coated with poly-l-lysine for laminar fluid flow or tissue culture coated plastic for 4-point bending. Polyurethane scaffolds (Caligen Foam Ltd, Accrington, UK) were seeded with 5×10<sup>5</sup> in 100 μl cell suspension and incubated for 1 h at 37 °C to ensure cell attachment prior to scaffolds being flooded with medium in 6 well plates (<xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr">Sittichockechaiwut et al., 2009</xref>). Monolayer cultures were maintained for 24 h and 3D cultures were maintained for 7 day prior to loading.</p>

        <title>Mechanical stimulation of cells</title>
        <p>Prior to mechanical stimulation cultures were rinsed and starved in serum free medium overnight to minimise c-<italic>fos</italic> expression. Medium was replaced 1 h prior to loading to remove exogenous ATP. Eighty per cent of the medium in the wells was displaced at 2.4×10<sup>−4</sup> L s<sup>−1</sup> between 5 to 20 times in monolayer (<xref rid="f0005" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>A) and 5 times through a polyurethane foam base beneath each scaffold (<xref rid="f0005" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>B) to engender turbulent fluid flow. Laminar fluid flow was applied to cultures grown on poly-l-lysine coated slides inside a parallel flow chamber (<xref rid="f0005" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>C) powered by a peristaltic pump (<xref rid="bib27 bib11" ref-type="bibr">You et al., 2001; Huesa et al., 2010</xref>) such that the resultant shear stress applied was up to 23 dyne/cm<sup>2</sup>. A custom made 4-point bending rig was used to apply quantifiable substrate strain (1 Hz, peak 3400 μstrain, 10 min) to cultures grown on plastic slides. Although this is not pure substrate strain as it will induce an unquantifiable amount of fluid flow, we will refer to it as substrate strain for brevity from here on in (<xref rid="f0005" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>D) (<xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr">Armstrong et al., 2007</xref>). Static compression was applied to scaffolds placed between the platens of a Bose ElectroForce 3200 biodynamic chamber with an in house cone adaptation to reduce the volume of medium around the scaffold (0–20% compressive strain, single 2 min loading bout, <xref rid="f0005" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>E). Dynamic compressive loading was applied to additional scaffolds in the same apparatus (1 Hz, 5% compressive strain, 2 min loading bouts). For all experiments additional cultures were placed inside loading apparatus without loading to provide basal controls.</p>

          <p>Similarly to laminar fluid flow, significant ATP release from SaOS-2 was only detected after substrate strain was applied over a period of time. Substrate strain at 3400 μStrain increased ATP release 2.70 fold after 6 min (basal 0.438 picomol/10<sup>4</sup> cells, load 1.181 picomol/10<sup>4</sup> cells after 6 min, <italic>P</italic>&lt;0.001), increasing to 4.10 fold after 8 min (1.797 picomol/10<sup>4</sup> cells, <italic>P</italic>&lt;0.0001) and decreasing to 2.86 fold after 10 min (1.252 picomol/10<sup>4</sup> cells, <italic>P</italic>&lt;0.0001) In contrast, five bouts of turbulent fluid flow applied inside for the substrate strain rig generated an immediate 1.79 fold increase in ATP release (basal 0.439, load 0.789 picomol/10<sup>4</sup> cells, <italic>P</italic>&lt;0.05 <italic>cf</italic> basal, <xref rid="f0010" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>D), 2.38 fold increase after 2 min (1.042 picomol/10<sup>4</sup> cells, <italic>P</italic>&lt;0.001) and 2.48 fold after 4 min (1.09 picomol/10<sup>4</sup> cells, <italic>P</italic>&lt;0.0001) which was hydrolysed within 10 min (<xref rid="f0010" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>D).</p>

          <p>Mechanical loading of SaOS-2 reporter cells in the form of laminar fluid flow-induced shear stress up to 23 dyne/cm<sup>2</sup> for 5 min gave no significant increase in luciferase activity above basal levels (<xref rid="f0020" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref>C). Treatment of cells cultured on the slides and inside the parallel flow chamber with FBS and PTH gave a somewhat variable, but significant 4.8 fold increase in luciferase activity above basal levels (<italic>P</italic>&lt;0.05).</p>

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>The aims of this study were to investigate ATP release and IEG activation in response to turbulent fluid flow, laminar fluid flow, substrate strain, and 3D compressive loading in the same osteoblastic cell type, SaOS-2 cells (see <xref rid="t0005" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref> for summary of results). Our results show that with increasing amounts of loading the amount of ATP released also increased, suggesting that extracellular ATP may be an important primitive form of the “mechanostat” (<xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr">Frost, 2003</xref>) in bone by which dose dependent ATP release could influence osteogenesis <italic>in vivo</italic>. Whilst monolayer cultures of osteoblasts are an extremely well used and extensively characterised model system for osteoblast behaviour, we wanted to mimic the <italic>in vivo</italic> situation better. Therefore we cultured SaOS-2 cells in a 3D scaffold culture system in which increased proliferation and extracellular matrix deposition occurs after compressive loading (<xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr">Sittichockechaiwut et al., 2009</xref>), consistent with the effects of extracellular ATP (<xref rid="bib20 bib14" ref-type="bibr">Shimegi, 1996; Nakano et al., 2007</xref>). Surprisingly, we could not detect any significant ATP release in 3D in response to up to 20% static compressive loading or 5% cyclic compressive loading despite this type of loading being osteogenic to MLO-A5 osteoblast cells (<xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr">Sittichockechaiwut et al., 2009</xref>). This lack of ATP release may be attributable to specific mechanical properties of the polyurethane scaffolds used. Cells within polyurethane scaffolds will experience very different complex combinations of mechanical stimuli depending upon cell attachment to the scaffold and the direction of the loading force in relation to the individual scaffold struts (<xref rid="bib22" ref-type="bibr">Sittichokechaiwut et al., 2010</xref>). Whilst we measured a global response, cells can receive substrate tension or compression or indeed neither stimulus. In the case of the cyclic compressive loading a certain amount of unquantifiable oscillatory fluid flow is generated, but clearly this is below the threshold level required to induce ATP release. We did however, detect significant levels of ATP release in response to turbulent fluid flow in 3D. The extent of the increase was more than that seen in monolayer, suggesting that osteoblast-like cells are more responsive to this type of fluid flow in 3D. Therefore the amount of ATP released in response to turbulent fluid flow in bone <italic>in vivo</italic> would have been underestimated based on previous work using monolayer cultures of osteoblasts <italic>in vitro</italic>. These findings are in consistent with the effects of fluid flow upon osteoblast cultures in 3D scaffolds which significantly increase the osteogenic response (<xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">Bancroft et al., 2002</xref>).</p>
      <p>Laminar fluid flow, in contrast to turbulent fluid flow, induced a time dependent “all or nothing” response to loading. There was no ATP release at shear stresses of 4.6 Dyne/cm<sup>2</sup>, but at 13.8 and 23 Dyne/cm<sup>2</sup> there was significantly increased ATP release between 3 and 5 min of loading which peaked at 1.239 and 1.344 picomol/10<sup>4</sup> cells, equivalent to a concentration of 54 to 56 nM ATP for both levels of stimuli. The amount of ATP released in response to laminar fluid flow in this study is very similar to a previous study where 59.8 nM ATP was released from MC3T3-E1 osteoblasts subjected to laminar fluid flow-induced shear stresses of 12 dyne/cm<sup>2</sup> for 10 min (<xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">Genetos et al., 2005</xref>). The fact that there is no more ATP released from SaOS-2 cells at 23 dyne/cm<sup>2</sup> than at 13.8 dyne/cm<sup>2</sup> and that approximately the same amount of ATP is released from MC3T3-E1 cells in response to 12 dyne/cm<sup>2</sup> suggests that osteoblasts have a maximum response to laminar fluid flow, suggesting that shear stress-induced ATP release is part of the mechanostat regulation of bone remodelling in response to loading. Turbulent fluid flow engendered rapid ATP release whereas laminar fluid flow engenders gradual ATP release from SaOS-2 cells. This suggests that SaOS-2 cells can detect the differences between multidirectional and uniaxial fluid movement. Previously, immortalised human foetal osteoblast cells subjected to laminar fluid flow demonstrated increased intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> ion concentration, however oscillating fluid flow had a less potent effect than either steady or pulsing flow (<xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr">Jacobs et al., 1998</xref>). This is in contrast to the effects of these kinds of fluid movements upon ATP release and although calcium signalling often correlates to ATP release the two may be mutually exclusive. MC3T3-E1 osteoblasts cultured in ceramic scaffolds proliferated uniformly in response to oscillatory but not unidirectional flow (<xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">Du et al., 2009</xref>), which taken together with the results of this study further suggest that osteoblasts respond differently to different types of flow.</p>
      <p>Similarly to laminar fluid flow, our substrate strain model (which will also induced unquantifiable amounts of fluid flow) induced ATP release from SaOS-2 cells which was time dependent. Substrate strain at 3400 μStrain increased ATP release 4.1 fold after 8 min. This suggests that substrate strain, in combination with fluid flow, is important in inducing ATP release from osteoblasts in bone that is subjected to longer periods of loading. In contrast, five bouts of turbulent fluid flow inside the rig without any substrate strain applied generated an immediate 1.79 fold increase which then became hydrolysed within 10 min. In an <italic>in vivo</italic> system this could be useful for maintaining localised autocrine/paracrine signalling at discrete foci (<xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">Bowler et al., 2001</xref>). The transient nature of this signal emphasises the need for longer periods of oscillating fluid flow to generate osteogenic responses throughout 3D scaffolds for tissue engineering (<xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">Du et al., 2009</xref>).</p>
      <p>In order to determine which type of mechanical loading would lead to activation of downstream signalling cascades to activate immediate early genes we performed real time PCR on cells subjected to turbulent fluid flow and substrate strain. c-<italic>fos</italic> mRNA increased 3.4 fold in response to substrate strain, but in contrast to a previous study using MC3T3-E1 cells (<xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr">Wadhwa et al., 2002</xref>), <italic>Cox-2</italic> mRNA expression in SaOS-2 cells decreased 0.6 fold in response to turbulent fluid flow. Previous studies have shown that over expression of <italic>Cox-2</italic> caused decreased proliferation and increased apoptosis (<xref rid="bib26" ref-type="bibr">Xu et al., 2006</xref>), so perhaps a decrease in <italic>Cox-2</italic> expression could represent the early stages of increased SaOS-2 cell proliferation and survival. The lack of any change in <italic>Cox-2</italic> in response to substrate strain suggests that this is a turbulent fluid flow mediated response and not necessarily ATP dependent as substrate strain also induced ATP release. Surprisingly there were no changes in <italic>Egr-2</italic> or c-<italic>jun</italic>; this might be explained by the species difference of the cells used as changes in both these genes previously reported were from a mouse derived cell line (<xref rid="bib27 bib15" ref-type="bibr">You et al., 2001; Ott et al., 2009</xref>) unlike human derived SaOS-2 cells (<xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr">Rodan et al., 1987</xref>) used in this study.</p>
      <p>To determine if the increased c-<italic>fos</italic> mRNA was due to transcriptional activation rather than stabilisation of the mRNA, we measured c-<italic>fos</italic> promoter activation using a c-<italic>fos</italic> luciferase report SaOS-2 cell line. Although turbulent fluid flow did not significantly increase c-<italic>fos</italic> mRNA, it did increase c-<italic>fos</italic> promoter activation both in monolayer, and as with ATP release, to a more significant level in 3D. This suggests that SaOS-2 cells are more responsive to turbulent fluid flow in a 3D scaffold that better replicates the bone microenvironment.</p>
      <p>The lack of c-<italic>fos</italic> activation in SaOS-2 cells subjected to laminar fluid flow-induced shear stresses of up to 23 dyne/cm<sup>2</sup> for 5 min coupled with a previous study that demonstrated increased c-<italic>fos</italic> activation in osteoblasts in response to laminar fluid flow-induced shear stress at 12 dyne/cm<sup>2</sup> applied for 60 min (<xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr">Pavalko et al., 1998</xref>) would suggest that c-<italic>fos</italic> transcriptional activation in response to laminar fluid flow requires prolonged flow application.</p>
      <p>Substrate strain together with strain-induced fluid flow activated the c-<italic>fos</italic> promoter more than fluid flow alone. This suggests that the c-<italic>fos</italic> promoter is sensitive to multiple types of mechanical stimuli and where there is more than one type of loading present there is a cumulative effect upon c-<italic>fos</italic> promoter activation. This is similar to a previous study in MC3T3-E1 cells which demonstrated the combined effects of substrate strain in combination and fluid flow had a greater effect on c-<italic>fos</italic> activation than substrate strain alone (<xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr">Tanaka et al., 2005</xref>). There were no significant changes in ATP release or c-<italic>fos</italic> promoter activation in SaOS-2 cells in response to static compression (<xref rid="f0010" ref-type="fig">Figs.2</xref>E and <xref rid="f0020" ref-type="fig">4</xref>E), suggesting that this type of loading in SaOS-2 osteoblasts does not induce the immediate release of ATP nor activation of IEGs. Taken together these findings suggest that scaffolding materials in tissue engineering need to be porous enough to allow fluid flow and rigid enough to conduct strain to provide the mechanical stimuli necessary to stimulate the signals associated with bone formation.</p>
      <p>This is the first study to record the effects of turbulent fluid flow, laminar fluid flow, substrate strain and compressive loading upon one cell type. The results demonstrate for the first time ATP release from osteoblasts in response to substrate strain in monolayer and turbulent fluid flow in 3D. The increased response to turbulent fluid flow in 3D demonstrates enhanced sensitivity of SaOS-2 cells to flow in the 3D environment. In contrast, the lack of response to loading via compression of the scaffold in which they are contained in suggests this type of substrate strain does not play a role in mechanically induced signalling mechanisms in the short term. Overall, the findings of this study demonstrate the concentration of ATP released in response to mechanical loading varied in a time, direction and strain dependent manner that may represent a local mechanostat in bone that may influence osteogenesis.</p>
