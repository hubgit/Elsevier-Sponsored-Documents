      <abstract>
        <p>African swine fever virus (ASFV) encodes an AP endonuclease (pE296R) which is essential for virus growth in swine macrophages. We show here that the DNA repair functions of pE296R (AP endonucleolytic, 3′ → 5′ exonuclease, 3′-diesterase and nucleotide incision repair (NIR) activities) and DNA binding are inhibited by reducing agents. Protein pE296R contains one intramolecular disulfide bond, whose disruption by reducing agents might perturb the interaction of the viral AP endonuclease with the DNA substrate. The characterization of the 3′ → 5′ exonuclease and 3′-repair diesterase activities of pE296R indicates that it has strong preference for mispaired and oxidative base lesions at the 3′-termini of single-strand breaks. Finally, the viral protein protects against DNA damaging agents in both prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells, emphasizing its importance <italic>in vivo</italic>. The biochemical and genetic properties of ASFV AP endonuclease are consistent with the repair of DNA damage generated by the genotoxic intracellular environment of the host macrophage.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>The maintenance of DNA integrity is essential not only for the survival of cellular organisms but also viruses. Various exogenous and endogenous agents can induce DNA damage which leads to mutations, DNA replication blocks and genetic instability (<xref rid="bib2 bib25" ref-type="bibr">Alberts, 2002; Lindahl, 1993</xref>). A large variety of modifications in DNA are caused by these agents, including abasic sites, single and double strand DNA breaks, and alkylated and oxidized bases. Eukaryotic, prokaryotic and archaea organisms possess a range of highly conserved DNA repair pathways. The mammalian Base Excision Repair (BER) is initiated by a DNA glycosylase that excises damaged or inappropriate bases, such as uracil, generating an abasic site that is subsequently incised by an apurinic/apyrimidinic (AP) endonuclease, giving rise to a 3′-OH group and a 5′-deoxyribose phosphate (dRP) (<xref rid="bib6 bib11 bib24" ref-type="bibr">David et al., 2007; Friedberg and Wood, 1996; Lindahl, 1990</xref>). This dRP group is eliminated by the dRP lyase activity of the specific BER DNA polymerase during the gap-filling step. Finally, a DNA ligase seals the nick. In the alternative to BER, Nucleotide Incision Repair (NIR) pathway, the same AP endonucleases incise DNA strands containing various oxidized bases, as well as α-anomeric dA, dT and dC nucleotides, by cleaving the DNA backbone on the 5′ side of the lesion and generating a nick with 3′-OH termini (<xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr">Ishchenko et al., 2006</xref>). In addition, oxidizing agents induce DNA strand breaks with blocking groups such as 3′-phosphate (3′-P) and/or 3′-phosphoglycolate (3′-PG) that should be removed by the 3′-phosphatase and 3′-phosphodiesterase activities of AP endonucleases. Furthermore, AP endonucleases display 3′ → 5′ exonuclease activity (<xref rid="bib3 bib20" ref-type="bibr">Chou and Cheng, 2002; Kerins et al., 2003</xref>) that improves the fidelity of DNA repair and may also be involved in alternative repair pathways for misincorporated oxidized dNTPs (<xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr">Ishchenko et al., 2005</xref>).</p>
      <p>AP endonucleases are classified into two families according to their homology to <italic>E. coli</italic> AP endonucleases: exonuclease III or Xth and endonuclease IV or Nfo (<xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">Demple, 1996</xref>). African swine fever virus (ASFV) AP endonuclease is an Nfo-like protein encoded by open reading frame E296R (<xref rid="bib22 bib28 bib36" ref-type="bibr">Lamarche and Tsai, 2006; Redrejo-Rodríguez et al., 2006; Yáñez et al., 1995</xref>). Intriguingly, ASFV does not encode any DNA glycosylase, raising the possibility that the viral AP endonuclease and the repair DNA polymerase (pol X) might eliminate DNA damage in an alternative viral BER pathway (<xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr">Garcia-Escudero et al., 2003</xref>). Protein pE296R contains AP endonuclease and 3′ → 5′ exonuclease activities (<xref rid="bib22 bib28" ref-type="bibr">Lamarche and Tsai, 2006; Redrejo-Rodríguez et al., 2006</xref>). Recently, 3′-phosphodiesterase, 3′-phosphatase and weak NIR activities have also been characterized in pE296R (<xref rid="bib22" ref-type="bibr">Lamarche and Tsai, 2006</xref>). Sequence alignment and 3D structure prediction by homology modelling suggest that protein pE296R, like Nfo protein, is a metalloenzyme with a trinuclear Zn<sup>2+</sup> core. Moreover, the <italic>E296R</italic> gene is required for viral growth in swine macrophages, the natural host cell of ASFV, presumably due to its DNA repair functions (<xref rid="bib28" ref-type="bibr">Redrejo-Rodríguez et al., 2006</xref>).</p>
      <p>Cells of the immune system, including monocytes, macrophages and neutrophils, have been reported to produce H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>, O<sub>2</sub><sup>•−</sup> and NO as a response to certain viruses (<xref rid="bib21 bib32" ref-type="bibr">Klebanoff and Coombs, 1992; Suzuki et al., 1997</xref>). These immune cells are susceptible to infection by ASFV (<xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">Fernandez et al., 1992</xref>) and, therefore, the virus may undergo an oxidative stress during its replication in the cytoplasm (<xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr">García-Beato et al., 1992</xref>) which would generate lesions in the viral DNA consisting of oxidized bases and single-strand breaks bearing 3′-blocking termini. In both prokaryote and eukaryote kingdoms, cellular resistance to H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> exposure has been attributed to the 3′-repair diesterase and 3′ → 5′ exonuclease activities of AP endonucleases (<xref rid="bib8 bib33 bib35" ref-type="bibr">Demple et al., 1986; Unk et al., 2001; Wilson et al., 1995</xref>). Similarly, the H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>-induced oxidative injuries in the replicating and/or already replicated ASFV genomes might be removed by the 3′-repair activities of the viral AP endonuclease.</p>
      <p>Interestingly, the major human AP endonuclease (APE1) is sensitive to the redox environment, since its AP endonuclease activity is inhibited under highly oxidizing conditions (<xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr">Kelley and Parsons, 2001</xref>), while in the case of the <italic>E. coli</italic> Nfo protein, it has been shown that the 3′ → 5′ exonuclease activity is inhibited by the reducing agent DTT (<xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr">Kerins et al., 2003</xref>).</p>
      <p>These observations led us to examine whether the different activities of ASFV AP endonuclease are sensitive to redox agents. In addition, we have further characterized the NIR and 3′ → 5′ exonuclease activities with regard to base pair preferences of protein pE296R. Furthermore, to elucidate the <italic>in vivo</italic> role of the viral AP endonuclease, we have first examined complementation of the AP endonuclease-deficient <italic>E. coli</italic> strain to chronic exposure of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>, methylmethanesulfonate (MMS) and <italic>tert</italic>-butyl hydroperoxide (<italic>t</italic>-BuO<sub>2</sub>H) by expression of the pE296R and Nfo proteins. Second, we tested the effect of these genotoxic agents on cells infected with wild type ASFV and a mutant virus lacking the <italic>E296R</italic> gene (<xref rid="bib28" ref-type="bibr">Redrejo-Rodríguez et al., 2006</xref>). Our results strongly suggest that the ASFV AP endonuclease is an enzyme adapted to repair diverse DNA damages in an oxidizing intracellular environment.</p>

        <title>The AP endonucleolytic activity of pE296R is inhibited by reducing agents</title>
        <p>In previous studies, dithiothreitol (DTT) has been frequently used in reaction buffers for various AP endonucleases of different origins (<xref rid="bib23 bib30 bib34" ref-type="bibr">Levin et al., 1988; Salas-Pacheco et al., 2003; Wilson, 2005</xref>), including ASFV AP endonuclease (<xref rid="bib22 bib28" ref-type="bibr">Lamarche and Tsai, 2006; Redrejo-Rodríguez et al., 2006</xref>). However, it has been shown that DTT strongly inhibits the 3′ → 5′ exonuclease activity of Nfo (<xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr">Kerins et al., 2003</xref>). Since it was possible that reducing agents might also inhibit any of the different repair activities of pE296R protein, we performed, as a first approach, AP endonuclease assays with the viral enzyme. The assays were carried out with an AP site-containing duplex oligonucleotide, in the presence of different concentrations of DTT and β-mercaptoethanol (β-ME) (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>). The AP endonucleolytic activity of pE296R shows a slight increase in the presence of a low DTT concentration (50 μM, <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>A, lane 3 and <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>B), but at 1 mM and higher DTT concentrations AP site incision was strongly inhibited with less than 10% of the activity remaining (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>A, lanes 7–9, and <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>B). With β-ME, almost complete inhibition is observed at concentrations of 10 mM and higher (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>A, lanes 12–14 and <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>B, inset).</p>
        <p>We calculated afterwards the kinetic parameters for AP endonuclease activity of pE296R in the presence and absence of 0.5 mM DTT (see details in <xref rid="sec1" ref-type="sec">Materials and methods</xref>). In the presence of DTT the <italic>K</italic><sub>M</sub> value increased moderately, from 120 ± 20 nM to 170 ± 25 nM, while the catalytic efficiency (<italic>k</italic><sub>cat</sub>/<italic>K</italic><sub>M</sub>) was reduced almost 3-fold: 48.7 min<sup>− 1</sup> μM<sup>− 1</sup> without DTT versus 17.3 min<sup>− 1</sup> μM<sup>− 1</sup> with DTT. This difference confirms the negative effect of DTT on the catalytic activity of the viral AP endonuclease.</p>
        <p>To see whether the effect of reducing agents on AP endonuclease activity of protein pE296R is permanent or it is reversible under oxidizing conditions, we studied the effect of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> on the DTT-reduced pE296R protein. Human APE1 is inhibited by H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> and diamide in a reversible way by DTT (<xref rid="bib26" ref-type="bibr">Masuda et al., 1998</xref>); therefore, we included the effect of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> and DTT on the purified APE1 as a control. In this experiment, we pre-incubated the proteins with or without DTT (20 min at 4 °C) and then with or without H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> (10 min at 4 °C) before performing the incision assays (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figs. 1</xref>C and D). The incision activity of APE1 was stimulated by DTT and inhibited by H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>, this inhibition being partially reverted by DTT (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>C, lanes 1–5). In the case of ASFV AP endonuclease, we found that the AP endonuclease activity was not affected by H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>C, lane 8) but, as expected, was strongly inhibited by DTT (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>C, lane 7). This inhibition by DTT was reverted by H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> in a dose-dependent manner (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>C, lanes 9–13 and panel D). However, no reversion was found by incubation with Zn<sup>2+</sup> cation (not shown), ruling out the possibility that the DTT-dependent inhibition found might be due to the formation of a Zn<sup>2+</sup>–DTT complex, as has been shown for other zinc-containing enzymes (<xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">Cornell and Crivaro, 1972</xref>). Also, the inhibition by DTT was not reverted by other divalent cations, including Co<sup>2+</sup>, Ca<sup>2+</sup> and Ni<sup>2+</sup>.</p>

        <title>The 3′ → 5′ exonuclease, NIR and 3′-repair diesterase activities of pE296R are sensitive to DTT</title>
        <p>To further examine the redox modulation of protein pE296R <italic>in vitro</italic>, we also measured the effect of DTT on the 3′ → 5′ exonuclease, NIR, 3′-phosphatase and 3′-phosphodiesterase activities of the ASFV protein. DTT inhibited the exonuclease activity of pE296R (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>). Moreover, incubation with H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> turned back the DTT effect (data not shown).</p>
        <p>Inhibition of NIR activity by reducing agents was examined on 5,6-dihydrouracil (DHU)-containing duplex oligonucleotide. In the absence of DTT, pE296R shows significant NIR activity (compare lanes 10 and 11 of <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>A), in agreement with a previous report (<xref rid="bib22" ref-type="bibr">Lamarche and Tsai, 2006</xref>). At low DTT concentrations, NIR activity is slightly affected (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>A, lanes 12–14), but strongly inhibited at higher DTT concentrations in a dose-dependent manner (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>A, lanes 15–18, and 2B). We have used both 5′ and 3′-labelled substrates to verify that the incision was indeed on the 5′-side of the damaged nucleotide (data not shown). It should be stressed that the pE296R protein was purified from <italic>E. coli</italic> BH110 strain, ruling out the possibility of contamination by a bacterial AP endonuclease. We also found a strong inhibition of 3′-phosphatase and 3′-phosphodiesterase activities of pE296R (not shown).</p>

        <title>The DNA binding capacity of pE296R is affected by reducing agents</title>
        <p>To examine the mechanism of inhibition of DNA repair activities of the viral protein by reducing agents, we measured pE296R binding to an AP site-containing DNA duplex using electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA) (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>). We used an oligonucleotide with a 5′-phosphothioate bound to the abasic sugar, to block AP endonuclease incision activity. About 45% of the substrate (open head arrow) in the absence of DTT was in complex with the enzyme and produced a shifted band (black head arrow) (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>A, lane 2 and B). The increase of DTT concentration produced a decrease of protein–DNA complex formation (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>A, lanes 3–9 and B). Moreover, the patterns of inhibition of endonuclease activity and DNA binding are similar, suggesting that the inhibition of catalytic activity of the viral protein by reducing agents is due to impairment of the recognition/binding step. This is further supported by the difference in <italic>K</italic><sub>M</sub> values at 0 and 0.5 mM DTT.</p>

        <title>Purified native pE296R contains disulfide bonds</title>
        <p>The ASFV protein pE296R sequence contains 7 cysteine residues. This led us to consider whether the inhibitory effect of DTT might be related to the rupture of one or more potential disulfide bonds. To examine whether pE296R contains disulfide bonds, we incubated the viral protein with or without DTT and then treated with the alkylating agent 4-acetamido-4′-maleimidylstilbene-2,2′-disulfonic acid (AMS, 0.5 kDa). As shown in <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref>, after alkylation, both reduced or non-reduced pE296R migrated in SDS-PAGE more slowly than non-alkylated pE296R (lanes 4–5 versus 2–3) suggesting the presence of free cysteine residues in the non-reduced form of the protein. Alkylated proteins migrated as single species indicating that the protein sample was in the same oxidation state. Importantly, after alkylation the non-reduced form migrated faster than the reduced form of pE296R. Based on interpolation of the migration distance of the molecular weight markers (lane 1), we calculated an empirical size for alkylated proteins of 38.7 and 39.8 kDa for the non-reduced and reduced preparations, respectively (with a <italic>R</italic><sup>2</sup> of 0.85 and an estimated error of ± 0.15 kDa). The difference of size in the two alkylated bands was 1.1 ± 0.15 kDa suggesting that the reduced pE296R protein contains 2 more AMS molecules than the non-reduced pE296R protein. Based on this result, we propose that the native pE296R protein has one disulfide bond and that break-up of this cysteine-cysteine bond by reducing agents might lead to the loss of DNA binding and enzymatic activities of pE296R.</p>
        <p>Although the <italic>in vivo</italic> significance of these observations is not known at present, it is tempting to speculate that the presence of a disulfide bond in the viral AP endonuclease may provide a mechanism for regulating the enzyme activity in the infected cells by inducing or breaking this bond. In relation to this possibility, it is interesting to mention that ASFV codes for a sulfhydryl oxidase (<xref rid="bib29" ref-type="bibr">Rodríguez et al., 2006</xref>), which might be involved in the formation of the disulfide bond. Further work will be required to verify this possibility and determine the state of the pE296R disulfide bond during the viral infection, as well as to ascertain its contribution to the viral AP endonuclease functions <italic>in vivo</italic>.</p>

        <title>The NIR and 3′-end clearing activities of pE296R suggest its role in repairing oxidative damage to DNA</title>
        <p>Our finding that reducing agents inhibit pE296R <italic>in vitro</italic> led us to re-examine some of the biochemical properties of the recombinant protein in the absence of reducing agents. First, we measured enzyme saturation curves for all activities of the ASFV AP endonuclease (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref>). The saturation profile for the different activities can be classified in two groups. AP endonuclease, 3′-phosphatase and 3′-phosphodiesterase reach the maximum activity at 10 nM enzyme concentration. The AP endonuclease activity was the most efficient, followed closely by 3′-phosphatase and 3′-phosphodiesterase activities of the protein (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref>). In contrast, the 3′ → 5′ exonuclease on a correctly paired substrate and NIR activity on DHU and 5-hydroxycytosine (5ohC) were very low and required much higher enzyme concentrations to cleave 5–20% of DNA substrate. The exonuclease activity on a 3′-mismatched substrate showed an intermediate profile, being, as described previously (<xref rid="bib28" ref-type="bibr">Redrejo-Rodríguez et al., 2006</xref>), much more efficient than on the substrate with regular base pair, which further supports the proofreading role of its exonuclease activity. To further characterize the substrate specificity of pE296R we measured its nucleotide incision activity on full duplex oligonucleotides containing different damaged nucleotides, such as α-deoxyadenine (α-dA), 3,<italic>N</italic><sup>4</sup>-ethenocytosine (ɛC) and 1,<italic>N</italic><sup>6</sup>-ethenoguanine (ɛA). αdA constitutes a major adduct detected in irradiated DNA under anoxic condition, whereas etheno(ɛ)-adducts ɛC and ɛA are generated in DNA by products of lipid peroxidation. In contrast with the results obtained with <italic>E. coli</italic> Nfo, assayed in parallel as a positive control, no activity was found with pE296R on all the substrates tested (data not shown) suggesting that the ASFV protein is not a classic NIR endonuclease and has limited substrate specificity as compared to <italic>E. coli</italic> Nfo, yeast Apn1 and human APE1. However, the activity of pE296R on DHU and 5ohC implies a partial involvement of the viral enzyme in the NIR pathway, a conclusion that is supported by the complementation studies reported below.</p>
        <p>It was previously demonstrated that the AP endonucleases can cleanse DNA 3′-termini from oxidized bases misincorporated during DNA replication or generated directly in the DNA by ROS (<xref rid="bib16 bib27" ref-type="bibr">Ishchenko et al., 2005; Parsons et al., 2005</xref>). To examine whether the viral 3′ → 5′ exonuclease activity may also act directly on damaged 3′-ends, we assayed this activity on nicked duplex DNA containing regular and a broad range of damaged and mismatched base pairs at the 3′-side of the single-strand break. As shown in <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6</xref>, DNA substrates containing 3′-terminal mismatches A/C and C/T and damaged bases were very efficiently cleaned up by the pE296R 3′ → 5′ exonuclease activity. In contrast, the matched pairs A/T, G/C, and C/G were very weakly degraded. Nevertheless, the matched base pair T/A was more efficiently processed by pE296R as compared to A/T (20% versus 5%). In keeping with this, the 3′-terminal damaged pyrimidines (U, DHU and 5ohC) were removed with higher efficiency than damaged purines inosine (I) and 7,8-dihydro-8-oxoguanine (8oxoG) (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6</xref>), possibly because of the size of the enzyme's active site pocket which may accommodate more easily smaller nucleotides. The efficient removal of 3′-terminal oxidized nucleotides suggests that ASFV pE296R 3′ → 5′ exonuclease activity may act not only as a backup for DNA polymerase proofreading system, but also as an alternative damage-cleansing function for misincorporated damaged nucleotides, as it was proposed for host AP endonucleases (<xref rid="bib16 bib27" ref-type="bibr">Ishchenko et al., 2005; Parsons et al., 2005</xref>).</p>
        <p>As expected, the highest activity of pE296R was observed on DNA substrates containing 3′-blocking groups (tetrahydrofuran (THF) and phosphate). The DNA strand breaks generated by ROS are refractory to DNA repair synthesis because of sugar and/or phosphate residues that block their 3′ termini. Removal of the 3′-blocking groups restores normal nucleotide primers with 3′-OH termini which is an essential step in the repair of these ROS-induced DNA strand breaks. The highly efficient 3′-repair diesterase activities of pE296R indicate their role in the repair of single-strand breaks in viral DNA to remove phosphates and phosphoglycolates at 3′-termini.</p>

        <title>Genotoxic challenges reveal the importance of pE296R DNA repair functions <italic>in vivo</italic></title>
        <p>To address the biological role of the various activities of ASFV AP endonuclease, we used two different approaches. First, we carried out complementation assays for the <italic>E. coli xth nfo</italic> strain (BH110) exposed to various genotoxic agents. Among the oxidizing agents, H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> is produced by the host immune cells infected with certain viruses and therefore might generate oxidative lesions in the ASFV DNA (<xref rid="bib18 bib32" ref-type="bibr">Israel and Gougerot-Pocidalo, 1997; Suzuki et al., 1997</xref>). It would thus be of particular interest to determine the capacity of the pE296R protein to confer protection to bacteria cells against H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> treatment. We used Nfo as a positive control for drug-sensitivity complementation of BH110 (<xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">Cunningham et al., 1986</xref>). As shown in <xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7</xref>A, the plasmids encoding pE296R and Nfo proteins, in contrast to empty vector, conferred resistance to BH110 cells when exposed to H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>. Protection by the ASFV <italic>E296R</italic> gene against <italic>t</italic>-BuO<sub>2</sub>H and MMS was also observed (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7</xref>A), confirming previous results in <italic>E. coli</italic> (<xref rid="bib22" ref-type="bibr">Lamarche and Tsai, 2006</xref>). Altogether, these data suggest that the viral AP endonuclease can repair 3′-blocking groups, oxidized bases and AP sites <italic>in vivo</italic>. Interestingly, the protection against H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> and MMS provided by both pE296R and Nfo endonucleases was very similar, suggesting highly efficient properties of the viral AP endonuclease to counteract DNA damage <italic>in vivo</italic>. It has been shown that expression of Nfo-G149D point mutant, that lacks the NIR activity but maintains the AP endonuclease activity <italic>in vitro</italic>, can complement double <italic>nfo xth</italic> mutant to the alkylating agent MMS challenge but not to <italic>t</italic>-BuO<sub>2</sub>H, suggesting that the NIR activity is involved in the removal of <italic>t</italic>-BuO<sub>2</sub>H-induced DNA damage (<xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr">Ishchenko et al., 2006</xref>) Thereby, although <italic>in vitro</italic> the ASFV AP endonuclease-catalyzed NIR activity is weaker compared to other DNA repair functions, the protection of bacterial cells by pE296R against <italic>t</italic>-BuO<sub>2</sub>H exposure (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7</xref>A, central panel) suggest a potential role of pE296R in the repair of oxidative DNA base lesions <italic>via</italic> the DNA glycosylase-independent NIR pathway <italic>in vivo</italic>. These results suggest that the viral AP endonuclease possesses all the DNA repair functions of the host homologous AP endonuclease to remove damage to cellular DNA induced by various genotoxic agents.</p>
        <p>To validate the results found in bacteria in the context of viral infections, we infected cells in the presence of the same genotoxic agents. We had previously shown that the replication of an ASFV mutant lacking the <italic>E296R</italic> gene (vΔE296R) was severely impaired in swine macrophages, but not in Vero cells (<xref rid="bib28" ref-type="bibr">Redrejo-Rodríguez et al., 2006</xref>). We therefore tested the effect of exposure with H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>, <italic>t</italic>-BuO<sub>2</sub>H and MMS on the replication of wild type ASFV and vΔE296R mutant virus in Vero cells. As shown in <xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7</xref>B, exposure to small concentrations of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> and MMS increased the viral titers, but higher concentrations of all three agents decreased viral production in a dose-dependent manner. Importantly, in control experiments, exposure to the drugs, at the concentrations used, did not affect survival of the uninfected cell (not shown). Wild type virus replication showed very low sensitivity to H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> and <italic>t</italic>-BuO<sub>2</sub>H, but was impaired in the presence of MMS. In contrast, vΔE296R virus growth showed higher sensitivity to H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> (<italic>p</italic>-value = 0.0036), supporting a role of the viral AP endonuclease in the repair of single-strand breaks with 3′-blocking termini. In eukaryotic systems exposure to <italic>t</italic>-BuO<sub>2</sub>H has been shown to result in a dose-dependent increase of single-strand breaks in DNA (<xref rid="bib1 bib14" ref-type="bibr">Aherne and O'Brien, 2000; Guidarelli et al., 1997</xref>). Exposure to <italic>t</italic>-BuO<sub>2</sub>H results in higher inhibition of vΔE296R replication, as compared to wild type virus (<italic>p</italic>-value = 0.0044). This effect corroborates the role of pE296R in the repair of DNA strand breaks in the viral genome, and may suggest the involvement of the NIR pathway in the drug-resistance. The fact that the ASFV genome encodes an AP endonuclease as well as a DNA repair polymerase and DNA ligase, but not for a DNA glycosylase, is in line with the existence of such a route in the infected cell that might operate, in some cases, as an alternative to a viral BER system. As mentioned above, MMS-induced DNA damage is repaired by BER in prokaryotic and eukaryotic systems (<xref rid="bib5 bib31" ref-type="bibr">Cunningham et al., 1986; Sobol et al., 1996</xref>). Therefore, the finding that exposure to MMS dramatically reduces the titers of vΔE296R more than in the wild type virus (<italic>p</italic>-value = 0.037), indicates that processing of AP sites through the BER pathway is also involved in viral genome maintenance.</p>
        <p>Interestingly, we have shown that the production of vΔE296R in swine macrophages strongly decreases in the absence of any treatment (<xref rid="bib28" ref-type="bibr">Redrejo-Rodríguez et al., 2006</xref>) whereas none of the genotoxic compounds tested decreased the production of vΔE296R in Vero cells to the same extent as in macrophages. This suggests that in the cytoplasm of the infected host macrophage the pE296R protein counteracts various types of DNA damage. Nevertheless, the sensitivity found in Vero cells in the presence of controlled amounts of oxidizing and alkylating agents proves the requirement of DNA repair functions of protein pE296R for viral growth. These results, along with the biochemical properties of the enzyme, support an essential role of the ASFV AP endonuclease in viral DNA repair pathway(s) to eliminate oxidative DNA base and sugar damage and strand breaks <italic>in vivo</italic>, as well as to process AP sites.</p>

Oligonucleotides were 5′-end labelled with T4 polynucleotide kinase (New England Biolabs) and [γ-<sup>32</sup>P]ATP. The purified 5′-<sup>32</sup>P-labelled oligonucleotides were annealed to complementary nonlabelled oligonucleotides in a buffer containing 60 mM NaCl and 20 mM Tris–HCl (pH 8.0) at 65 °C for 3 min and then slowly cooled to room temperature. The resulting duplex is referred to as X⋅Y, where X is either regular A, C, T and G bases, or the modified residues: THF, DHU, 5ohC, 8oxoG, I, αdA, ɛC and ɛA, whereas Y is an opposite regular base in the complementary strand. For the binding assays, we used the oligonucleotide RT-S with an abasic site bound by a 5′-phosphothioate to the adjacent nucleotide. For 3′-phosphatase, 3′-repair diesterase and 3′ → 5′ exonuclease assays we used nicked duplex oligonucleotide containing a blocking group at 3′ side and a phosphate at 5′ side of the single-strand break. The double stranded substrate used in each experiment is specified in the corresponding figure.</p>
