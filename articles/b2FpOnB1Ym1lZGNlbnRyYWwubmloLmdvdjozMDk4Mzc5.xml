          <title>Background &amp; Aims</title>
          <p>The pro-inflammatory functions of NF-κB must be tightly regulated to prevent inappropriate tissue damage and remodelling caused by activated inflammatory and wound-healing cells. The p50 subunit of NF-κB is emerging as an important repressor of immune and inflammatory responses, but by mechanisms that are poorly defined. This study aims to delineate p50 target genes in activated hepatic stellate cells and to outline mechanisms utilised in their repression.</p>
        </sec>
        <sec>
          <title>Methods</title>
          <p>Hepatic stellate cells were isolated from <italic>nfkb1</italic>(p50)-deficient or Wt mice and gene expression compared using microarray. Target genes were verified by qRT-PCR and p50-mediated HDAC-1 recruitment to the target genes demonstrated using chromatin immunoprecipitation.</p>
        </sec>
        <sec>
          <title>Results</title>
          <p>We identify p50 as transcriptional repressor of multiple pro-inflammatory genes including <italic>Ccl2</italic>, <italic>Cxcl10</italic>, <italic>Gm-csf</italic>, and <italic>Mmp-13</italic>. These genes are over-expressed in <italic>nfkb1</italic>(p50)-deficient mice suffering from chronic hepatitis and in fibrogenic/inflammatory hepatic stellate cells isolated from <italic>nfkb1</italic><sup>−/−</sup> liver. We identify <italic>Mmp-13</italic> as a <italic>bona-fide</italic> target gene for p50 and demonstrate that p50 is required for recruitment of the transcriptional repressor histone deacetylase (HDAC)-1 to κB sites in the <italic>Mmp-13</italic> promoter. Chromatin immunoprecipitations identified binding of HDAC-1 to specific regulatory regions of the <italic>Ccl2</italic>, <italic>Cxcl10</italic>, <italic>Gm-csf</italic> genes that contain predicted κB binding motifs. Recruitment of HDAC-1 to these genes was not observed in <italic>nfkb1</italic><sup>−/−</sup> cells suggesting a requirement for p50 in a manner similar to that described for <italic>Mmp-13</italic>.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>A limited but effective inflammatory response is essential for ensuring neutralisation of microbial pathogens following infection and for the removal of damaged and necrotic cells resulting from tissue trauma. However, this response is not without risk. If inflammation fails to resolve (as in chronic disease) then the tissue can be subject to significant cellular damage caused by highly toxic soluble factors (e.g. proteolytic enzymes) released by inflammatory cells (neutrophils, eosinophils and macrophages) that persist at the site of infection/trauma. For a “healthy” inflammatory response it is therefore important that the process follows its natural course from the initiation phase through to the resolution phase <xref rid="b0080 b0165" ref-type="bibr">[16,33]</xref>. Where this course is perturbed, and inflammation fails to resolve, then there is potential for tissue damage and pathological states <xref rid="b0005 b0175" ref-type="bibr">[1,35]</xref>. Tight regulation of the expression of inflammatory genes such as cytokines, chemokines, cell adhesion molecules, and proteolytic enzymes is a key factor in ensuring the appropriate induction and subsequent resolution of inflammation <xref rid="b0080 b0165" ref-type="bibr">[16,33]</xref>.</p>
      <p>NF-κB is now firmly established as a cardinal transcriptional regulator of inflammatory gene expression and it is now emerging that different forms of NF-κB have distinct functions to play in the inflammatory response <xref rid="b0065" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>. Mammalian NF-κB functions as homodimers or heterodimers generated from combinations of five Rel family proteins (RelA, c-Rel, RelB, p50 and p52). The five Rel family members share many conserved structural and functional features, for example they all have a similar Rel homology domain that enables dimerisation and DNA binding <xref rid="b0060" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>. However, there are also distinctive structural and functional properties for each subunit which influence the activities of a particular NF-κB dimer. RelA and p50 are constituents of the so-called canonical NF-κB pathway that is thought to play a dominant role in the control of inflammation <xref rid="b0140" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref>. The canonical pathway is activated in response to a wide variety of inflammatory stimuli including cytokines (e.g. TNF-α and IL-1β) and ligands for the Toll-like receptors (e.g. lipopolysaccharide). RelA:p50 NF-κB dimers are target end-points for the signaling pathways triggered by these stimuli. Under resting conditions these dimers are associated with the inhibitory protein IκBα. IκBα lowers the efficiency of NF-κB transport to the nucleus and interferes with DNA binding <xref rid="b0150" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref>. Inflammatory signals culminate in the release of NF-κB from IκBα enabling interaction with target κB sequence motifs in the regulatory regions of genes controlling the inflammatory response. In general terms, RelA:p50 functions to increase the rate of transcription of inflammatory genes. One way in which resolution of inflammation is assured is that RelA:p50 stimulates transcription of IκBα to provide a rapid negative feedback mechanism. However, several additional regulatory checkpoints operate to ensure tight control of NF-κB-directed inflammation, including mechanisms provided by the unique properties of the p50 subunit <xref rid="b0205 b0215" ref-type="bibr">[41,43]</xref>.</p>
      <p>The p50 subunit lacks a transactivation domain and as a consequence it can only stimulate transcription when either partnered with one of the transactivation domain-containing subunits RelA, c-Rel or RelB (p52 also lacks a transactivation domain), or when complexed with a transcriptional co-regulator such as Bcl3 or CBP. Homodimers of p50 can act as transcriptional repressors of pro-inflammatory genes and in this context are features of endotoxin-tolerant and tumour-associated macrophages <xref rid="b0035 b0145 b0155 b0215" ref-type="bibr">[7,29,31,43]</xref>. Mice lacking the gene (<italic>nfkb1</italic>) encoding the p50 subunit have highly elevated inflammatory responses to insults of the lung, liver, and kidney suggesting that perhaps the predominant role of p50 is to operate as a negative regulator of NF-κB-directed inflammation <xref rid="b0070 b0120 b0130" ref-type="bibr">[14,24,26]</xref>.</p>
      <p>We have previously reported that <italic>nfkb1</italic><sup>−/−</sup> mice suffer severe chronic inflammation and fibrosis in a model of iterative toxic injury of the liver <xref rid="b0120" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>. An important cellular regulator of the hepatic inflammatory and fibrogenic response is the hepatic stellate cell. This is a non-parenchymal liver cell that in response to injury transdifferentiates into a wound-healing myofibroblasts <xref rid="b0040 b0045" ref-type="bibr">[8,9]</xref>. In addition, recent data has shown that hepatic stellate cells act as antigen presenting cells within the liver <xref rid="b0185 b0195" ref-type="bibr">[37,39]</xref>. These properties suggest a role for hepatic stellate cells as important regulators of hepatic inflammation. In our previous study we noted a perturbation of inflammatory signaling in <italic>nfkb1</italic><sup>−/−</sup> hepatic stellate cells <xref rid="b0120" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>. For example, these cells aberrantly expressed TNF-α (both <italic>in vivo</italic> and <italic>in vitro</italic>) which could be attenuated by reconstitution of p50. We therefore concluded that <italic>nfkb1</italic><sup>−/−</sup> hepatic stellate cells are a useful model system to identify inflammatory genes that are subject to transcriptional repression by p50, and subsequently to determine how p50 inhibits transcription. In the present study, we identify 107 genes that are over-expressed in <italic>nfkb1</italic><sup>−/−</sup> hepatic stellate cells and by studying p50 regulation of 4 of these genes (<italic>Mmp-13</italic>, <italic>Gm-csf</italic>, <italic>Ccl2</italic>, and <italic>Cxcl10</italic>) we demonstrate that recruitment of the histone deacetylase (HDAC)-1 transcriptional repressor is a common mechanism by which p50 functions as a negative regulator of inflammation.</p>

Each PCR was performed in triplicate and the analysis was repeated three times from independent ChIP experiments. Real-time PCR analysis was performed on an ABI 7500HT sequence detection system. In brief, qPCRs comprised of 20 ng of cDNA template, 15 pmol each of sense and anti-sense oligonucleotide primers, and 6.5 μl of Jumpstart SYBR green master mix (Sigma) in a total reaction volume of 13 μl. After the initial 20 s incubation at 94 °C, qPCRs were performed using a 20 s annealing at 55 °C followed by a 30 s elongation step at 72 °C and a 5 s denaturation step at 94 °C. After each run, a dissociation curve was performed to ensure that no primer dimers contaminated the quantification and that the product had the expected melting temperature. A signal intensity value for each sample was calculated from the average of the experiments. Average values of eluates were normalized to average values of inputs after subtracting the background control, and differences between samples calculated using the following equation: [1/(2<italic>A</italic>)] × 100.

        <p>NF-κB DNA binding was determined by EMSA as previously described <xref rid="b0125" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref> using a <sup>32</sup>P end-labeled double-stranded oligonucleotide probe (Promega) containing a consensus NF-κB site. Nuclear extracts were prepared from p50 wt or EM1 and EM2 mutant transfected LX2 cells using a previously published protocol <xref rid="b0125" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>. Harvested cells were washed twice in ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline prior to lysis in Buffer A supplemented with 0.2% Nonidet P-40, 0.5 mm 4-(2-aminoethyl)benzenesulfonyl fluoride, 0.2 mm EDTA, and 15 μg/ml aprotinin. Lysates were centrifuged for 10 s at 13,000 rpm to collect crude nuclear pellets. Supernatants were discarded and pellets were washed twice in lysis buffer without NP-40 prior to resuspension in Buffer C supplemented with 0.5 mm 4-(2-aminoethyl) benzenesulfonyl fluoride, 0.2 mm EDTA, and 15 μg/ml aprotinin. All buffers contained protease inhibitor cocktail (Sigma, UK). After a 10-min incubation on ice with occasional vortexing, the extracts were cleared of insoluble nuclear material by centrifugation at 13,000 rpm for 30 s. Cleared nuclear extracts were transferred to fresh Eppendorf tubes, and their protein content was determined using the Bradford DC assay kit (Bio-Rad). EMSA reactions were assembled on ice and consisted of an initial 10-min incubation of 4 μl of Buffer C containing 2–10 μg of nuclear protein extract and 12 μl of water containing 2 μg of poly(dI–dC). Four microlitres of water containing 0.4 ng of radiolabeled double-stranded probe was then added to the reaction and, after mixing, was incubated for a further 20 min. EMSA reaction mixtures were then resolved by electrophoresis on an 8% non-denaturing polyacrylamide gel (37:5:1).</p>

        <title>Loss of nfkb1<sup>−/−</sup> results in widespread changes of genes controlling inflammation and fibrosis</title>
        <p>Microarray and subsequent Genespring analysis revealed a total of 228 genes that are differentially regulated by 2-fold or greater between Wt and <italic>nfkb1</italic><sup>−/−</sup> hepatic stellate cells (<xref rid="f0005" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref> and <xref rid="s0005" ref-type="sec">Supplementary Tables 1 and 2</xref>). Of these genes, 107 were up-regulated and 121 were down-regulated and represented genes involved in a wide variety of physiological processes relevant to immunity and wound-healing (<xref rid="f0005" ref-type="fig">Fig 1</xref>). As <italic>nfkb1</italic><sup>−/−</sup> mice display increased susceptibility to carbon tetrachloride (CCl<sub>4</sub>)-induced inflammation and fibrosis <xref rid="b0120" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>, we were particularly interested in genes over-expressed in <italic>nfkb1</italic><sup>−/−</sup> hepatic stellate cells that regulate these processes. Over-expressed inflammatory/fibrogenic genes identified include MMP-13 (38-fold); IL-1β (35-fold); Arginase 2 (13-fold), which is required for synthesis of proline, a critical component of collagen; coagulation factor V (7-fold); IL-13 receptor α2 (7-fold), which mediates induction of TGF-β1 expression in response to IL-13; CXCL10 (7-fold); GM-CSF (6-fold); IL-11 (5-fold), a well known profibrogenic cytokine; the acute phase protein Ceruloplasmin (5-fold); Vanin 3 (4-fold), a pantetheinase implicated in inflammation; IL-15 (3-fold); and CCL2 (2.5-fold). To validate the microarray data we employed qRT-PCR to compare expression of MMP-13, CXCL10, GM-CSF, and CCL2 (up-regulated), fibromodulin (down-regulated), and MMP-3 (no difference) between Wt and <italic>nfkb1</italic><sup>−/−</sup> hepatic stellate cells. As shown in <xref rid="f0010" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>, qRT-PCR confirmed elevated expression of MMP-13, CXCL10, GM-CSF and CCL2, and reduced expression of fibromodulin in <italic>nfkb1</italic><sup>−/−</sup> hepatic stellate cells with again no difference observed for MMP-3. Differences in the fold-increases detected by microarray and qRT-PCR most likely reflect a variety of technical differentials between the two methodologies as well as differences in normalisation of microarray versus qRT-PCR data. We also confirmed that total hepatic expression of MMP-13, CXCL10, and CCL2 are elevated for chronic CCl<sub>4</sub>-injured <italic>nfkb1</italic><sup>−/−</sup> mice compared with Wt controls (<xref rid="f0015" ref-type="fig">Fig 3</xref>).</p>

        <title>MMP-13 gene transcription is suppressed by the p50 product of nfkb1</title>
        <p>Since MMP-13 was highly over-expressed in <italic>nfkb1</italic><sup>−/−</sup> hepatic stellate cells we were next interested to determine if the p50 product of <italic>nfkb1</italic><sup>−/−</sup> exerts any influence on MMP-13 expression and gene transcription. We initially showed that over-expression of p50 will suppress expression of endogenous MMP-13 (<xref rid="f0020" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref>). To investigate MMP-13 transcription, the human hepatic stellate cell line LX2 <xref rid="b0200" ref-type="bibr">[40]</xref> was transfected with MMP-13-promoter-luciferase reporter constructs (<xref rid="f0025" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref>A) together with an expression vector for p50. Expression of p50 led to a 50% suppression of transcription from a luciferase reporter containing a 721 nucleotide long MMP-13 promoter. This effect was not observed with a shorter 227 nucleotide promoter containing only the proximal regulatory elements of the MMP-13 gene which by <italic>in silico</italic> analysis lacks a consensus κB site (<xref rid="f0025" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref>B). Treatment with LPS or TNF-α failed to relieve p50-mediated suppression of transcription indicating the potential for p50 to inhibit MMP-13 expression even under highly pro-inflammatory conditions (<xref rid="f0025" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref>C).</p>

        <title>HDAC-mediated repression of MMP-13 gene transcription</title>
        <p>NF-κB dimers regulate transcription by binding to κB sequences in the regulatory regions of target genes and via recruitment of co-activators (e.g. p300/CBP) or co-repressors (e.g. HDAC-1) which help to determine whether transcription is stimulated or suppressed, respectively <xref rid="b0010 b0030 b0050 b0170 b0210" ref-type="bibr">[2,6,10,34,42]</xref>. The p50 subunit of NF-κB can form either pro-inflammatory heterodimers with RelA or anti-inflammatory p50:p50 homodimers. The latter are believed to actively suppress gene transcription through the recruitment of histone deacetylases including HDAC-1 <xref rid="b0030 b0210" ref-type="bibr">[6,42]</xref>. ChIP analysis showed that both p50 and RelA are recruited to the MMP-13 promoter in hepatic stellate cells (<xref rid="f0030" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6</xref>A). Interaction of p50 with the MMP-13 promoter was confirmed with transfected p50 (<xref rid="f0030" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6</xref>B). This binding was, as expected, dependent on p50 dimerisation since mutant p50 proteins (EM1 and EM2), containing mutations that disrupt amino-acid residues in the Rel homology domain critical for p50 dimerisation, were not detected at the MMP-13 promoter by ChIP (<xref rid="f0030" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6</xref>B and C). EM1 expresses a mutant p50 that has amino acids Y270 and L272 mutated to alanine; these two amino-acid residues are predicted to influence homodimerisation and consequently DNA binding <xref rid="b0160" ref-type="bibr">[32]</xref>. EM2 carries the same two mutations plus an additional two amino acid switches, F310 and V313 which are predicted to further perturb DNA binding of p50 <xref rid="b0160" ref-type="bibr">[32]</xref>. These predictions were proved correct by EMSA analysis which showed reduced binding of EM1 to a consensus κB site compared with wild type p50 and undetectable binding of EM2 (<xref rid="f0030" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6</xref>D). We also detected binding of endogenous (<xref rid="f0030" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6</xref>E) and transfected HDAC-1 (<xref rid="f0030" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6</xref>F) to the MMP-13 promoter. Furthermore, recruitment of HDAC-1 to the MMP-13 promoter was dependent on p50 since we did not detect binding with ChIP in <italic>nfkb1</italic><sup>−/−</sup> cells (<xref rid="f0030" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6</xref>G). These data implicate HDAC-1 as a mediator of the suppressive effects of <italic>nfkb1</italic>/p50 on MMP-13 expression. To confirm this idea we determined the effects of a transfected HDAC-1 expression vector on MMP-13 promoter activity in LX2. As shown in <xref rid="f0035" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7</xref>A, transfection of p50 alone reduced MMP-13 transcription by 50% while co-transfection of p50 and HDAC-1 resulted in 70% suppression of transcription. By contrast treatment of hepatic stellate cells with the HDAC inhibitor trichostatin A prevented the repressive effects of transfected p50 and actually stimulated MMP-13 promoter activity above the control levels (<xref rid="f0035" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7</xref>B). Trichostatin A treatment also stimulated endogenous MMP-13 gene expression, with a 2-fold induction at 4 h treatment rising to 5-fold after 8 h. Taken together these data provide evidence that MMP-13 is a direct target for p50 which together with its co-repressor HDAC-1 acts to suppress MMP-13 transcription. As p50 is absent in <italic>nfkb1</italic><sup>−/−</sup> cells and <italic>nfkb1</italic><sup>−/−</sup> mouse liver, but there was no difference in HDAC-1 expression <xref rid="b0120" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>, we suggest that loss of this mechanism provides an explanation for the over-expression of MMP-13 in these cells and tissues.</p>

        <title>HDAC-1 recruitment is observed at multiple p50-repressed promoters</title>
        <p>We were next interested to determine if the elevated expression of GM-CSF, CCL2, and CXCL10 in <italic>nfkb1</italic><sup>−/−</sup> cells and liver was associated with p50-dependent recruitment of HDAC-1 to the regulatory regions of these genes. <italic>In silico</italic> analysis revealed multiple κB sites in the upstream promoter regions of the three genes (<xref rid="f0040" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8</xref>A). This information was used to select ChIP primers spanning two different κB per gene promoter. ChIP analysis of HDAC-1 recruitment to these regulatory sites was then determined in wild type and <italic>nfkb1</italic><sup>−/−</sup> cells (<xref rid="f0040" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8</xref>B). HDAC-1 binding was detected at one site in the GM-CSF gene (−3700), two sites in the CCl2 gene (−420 and −700) and at one site in the CXCL10 gene (−100). All of these HDAC-1 interactions were at near undetectable levels in <italic>nfkb1</italic><sup>−/−</sup> cells. The p50:HDAC-1 complex is therefore a transcriptional suppressor of multiple genes implicated in inflammation and tissue remodelling.</p>

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>Inflammation is a highly regulated process that, if unchecked, can lead to conditions of chronic tissue damage and accumulation of fibrotic tissue. NF-κB is a cardinal regulator of inflammation and therefore continues to be extensively investigated with the hope of development of improved anti-inflammatory drugs <xref rid="b0025 b0075" ref-type="bibr">[5,15]</xref>. Homodimers of the p50 subunit of NF-κB are features of the resolving phase of inflammatory responses and may operate as important transcriptional inhibitors of NF-κB-regulated inflammatory genes <xref rid="b0020" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>. The physiological consequences of loss of p50 expression have been documented in <italic>nfkb1</italic>-deficient mice which display enhanced M1-driven inflammation characterised by perturbed expression of TNF-α, IFN-β, CXCL10, and iNOS <xref rid="b0145 b0155" ref-type="bibr">[29,31]</xref>. These mice are also susceptible to severe inflammatory responses upon challenge of multiple organs <xref rid="b0115 b0120 b0130" ref-type="bibr">[23,24,26]</xref>. Intratracheal infection of mice with <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> is associated with induction of RelA/p50 dimers in the lung at 3 h which is followed by appearance of p50/p50 dimers after 6 h, indicating a role for p50 homodimers in resolution of lung inflammation <xref rid="b0110" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>. Challenge of <italic>nfkb1</italic><sup>−/−</sup> mice in this manner resulted in increased mortality, elevated neutrophil recruitment to the lung, and over-expression of KC, MIP-2, TNF-α, IL-6, and IL-1β at 6 h after infection <xref rid="b0110" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>. In a model of glomerular nephritis, Panzer et al. reported a similar shift from RelA/p50 to p50/p50 dimers during transition from the initiation to resolution phase of kidney inflammation <xref rid="b0130" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>. Mice lacking <italic>nfkb1</italic> displayed higher and prolonged expression of CCL2, CCL5, and TNF-α, increased numbers of infiltrating CD3<sup>+</sup> cells and higher rates of mortality. We have previously reported more severe inflammation and fibrosis in <italic>nfkb1</italic>-deficient mice in a model of chronic liver fibrosis <xref rid="b0120" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>. Taken together these models suggest that absence of p50 leads to the inappropriate expression of a variety of pro-inflammatory mediators resulting in severe unresolved inflammation. The present study improves our understanding of the role of p50 as a suppressor of inflammation by revealing that its recruitment of HDAC-1 provides a mechanism for the negative transcriptional regulation of at least four important pro-inflammatory genes (MMP-13, GM-CSF, CCL2, and CXCL10) that are over-expressed in the injured liver of <italic>nfkb1</italic><sup>−/−</sup> mice.cDNA microarray analysis revealed MMP-13 as the gene up-regulated by the greatest extent (37.7-fold) in <italic>nfkb1</italic><sup>−/−</sup> cells. MMP-13 is a protease with high selectivity for insoluble fibrillar collagens (in particular type I collagen) that is expressed in response to a variety of inflammatory mediators and in an NF-κB-dependent way <xref rid="b0015 b0085 b0100 b0105" ref-type="bibr">[3,17,20,21]</xref>. The over-expression of MMP-13, in the context of the elevated fibrosis observed in chronic injured livers of <italic>nfkb1</italic><sup>−/−</sup> mice, may therefore seem somewhat paradoxical. However, Uchinami et al. have previously described the attenuation of liver fibrosis in MMP-13 knockout mice <xref rid="b0180" ref-type="bibr">[36]</xref>. This effect results from MMP-13 being required for the initial inflammatory response to injury which is a major determinant of the subsequent fibrogenic response. MMP-13 probably stimulates inflammation by promoting the release of soluble active forms of inflammatory mediators (e.g. TNF-α) from their insoluble ECM-bound states <xref rid="b0180" ref-type="bibr">[36]</xref>. Of note, Uchinami observed a dramatic reduction in neutrophil infiltration in the sinusoids of injured MMP-13-deficient mice <xref rid="b0180" ref-type="bibr">[36]</xref>. A feature of injured <italic>nfkb1</italic><sup>−/−</sup> liver is extremely high numbers of infiltrating neutrophils <xref rid="b0120" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>. Suppression of MMP-13 expression by p50/p50 may therefore be an important mechanism for limiting neutrophilic inflammation and tissue damage. As demonstrated here, transfection of p50 inhibits expression of endogenous MMP-13 and suppresses activity of an MMP-13 promoter-luciferase reporter. Furthermore, both endogenous and transfected p50 can be detected at the MMP-13 promoter by ChIP. Specificity of this binding was confirmed by showing that dimerisation- and DNA-binding-defective p50 proteins fail to ChIP to the promoter. Our data, however, does not exclude the possibility that NF-κB subunits other than p50 and RelA may bind selected target genes. MMP-13 is therefore a <italic>bona-fide</italic> target gene for p50 which under conditions of excess relative to RelA will promote repression of MMP-13 gene transcription. Such conditions are described in the resolving phase of inflammation where p50/p50 dominates over RelA/p50 dimers <xref rid="b0055" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>. We conclude that absence of p50 is responsible for the highly elevated expression of MMP-13 (as well as CXCL10 and CCL2) in <italic>nfkb1</italic><sup>−/−</sup> cells and liver. This also supports the hypothesis that absence of p50 is responsible for the severe inflammatory responses of <italic>nfkb1</italic><sup>−/−</sup> mice. Of note, cells lacking the <italic>nfkb1</italic> gene effectively lack two proteins (p105 and p50) and also display defects in the expression and activity of the MAP3K Tpl2/Cot <xref rid="b0135" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>. Hence, attributing phenotypes observed in <italic>nfkb1</italic><sup>−/−</sup> cells and mice to functions of p50 requires substantiation with additional experiments such as those we describe above.</p>
      <p>As p50 lacks a transactivation domain its influences on transcription are dependent either upon dimerisation with RelA, c-Rel or RelB, or on the activities of co-regulators that assemble functional complexes with p50 at gene promoters. Co-regulators implicated as adapters of p50 function include HDAC-1, the IκB family protein Bcl3, and the histone acetylase CBP <xref rid="b0050 b0170 b0210" ref-type="bibr">[10,34,42]</xref>. The nature and type of p50:co-regulator complex assembled, appear to be context dependent and may result in stimulation or repression of transcription. For example, p50:p50:HDAC-1 assembles at the TNF-α promoter to inhibit transcription, by contrast p50:p50:CBP assembles at the IL-10 promoter in macrophages responding to LPS and stimulates transcription <xref rid="b0020" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>. The p50:p50:HDAC-1 prevents inappropriate transcription of TNF-α in fibrogenic hepatic stellate cells <xref rid="b0120" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>. We were therefore interested to determine if a similar mechanism operates at the MMP-13 gene. Both endogenous and transfected HDAC-1 were associated with the MMP-13 promoter in wild type but not in <italic>nfkb1</italic><sup>−/−</sup> cells. HDAC-1 over-expression enhanced the repressive effects of p50 on the MMP-13 promoter, while treatment of cells with the HDAC inhibitor trichostatin A blocked the repressive effects of transfected p50 on MMP-13. Recruitment of a p50 and HDAC-1 containing complex at the TNF-α and MMP-13 genes raises the possibility that this complex operates as an orchestrator of the inhibition of multiple pro-inflammatory genes. We showed that HDAC-1 associated with κB site-containing upstream regions of genes encoding GM-CSF, CCL2, and CXCL10, all of which are expressed at higher levels in <italic>nfkb1</italic><sup>−/−</sup> cells and liver tissue compared with wild type. The interaction of HDAC-1 with these genes was detected in wild type but not in <italic>nfkb1</italic><sup>−/−</sup> cells confirming a requirement of p50 for recruitment of HDAC-1.</p>
      <p>Previous work has identified the TNF-α, IL-6, and iNOS genes as being repressed by HDAC-1 in a p50-dependent manner <xref rid="b0120 b0210" ref-type="bibr">[24,42]</xref>. A similar mechanism operates at the HIV-1 long terminal repeat to promote latency of the virus, with potential for pro-inflammatory signals to relieve this mechanism and stimulate viral replication <xref rid="b0190" ref-type="bibr">[38]</xref>. By us now showing that p50-dependent recruitment of HDAC-1 orchestrates repression of MMP-13, GM-CSF, CCL2, and CXCL10 in a model of chronic liver inflammation and fibrosis, it can be concluded that the p50:p50:HDAC-1 complex is a master negative regulator of inflammation. The challenge is to define the molecular control of the recruitment and assembly of p50:p50:HDAC-1 and how this control is modulated in chronic unresolved states of inflammation.</p>
