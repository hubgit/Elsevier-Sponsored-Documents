      <abstract>
        <p>Human embryonic stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes (hESC-CM) are being developed for tissue repair and as a model system for cardiac physiology and pathophysiology. However, the signaling requirements of their growth have not yet been fully characterized. We showed that hESC-CM retain their capacity for increase in size in long-term culture. Exposing hESC-CM to hypertrophic stimuli such as equiaxial cyclic stretch, angiotensin II, and phenylephrine (PE) increased cell size and volume, percentage of hESC-CM with organized sarcomeres, levels of ANF, and cytoskeletal assembly. PE effects on cell size were separable from those on cell cycle. Changes in cell size by PE were completely inhibited by p38–MAPK, calcineurin/FKBP, and mTOR blockers. p38–MAPK and calcineurin were also implicated in basal cell growth. Inhibitors of ERK, JNK, and CaMK II partially reduced PE effects; PKG or GSK3β inhibitors had no effect. The role of p38–MAPK was confirmed by an additional pharmacological inhibitor and adenoviral infection of hESC-CM with a dominant-inhibitory form of p38–MAPK. Infection of hESC-CM with constitutively active upstream MAP2K3b resulted in an increased cell size, sarcomere and cytoskeletal assembly, elongation of the cells, and induction of ANF mRNA levels. siRNA knockdown of p38–MAPK inhibited PE-induced effects on cell size. These results reveal an important role for active protein kinase signaling in hESC-CM growth and hypertrophy, with potential implications for hESC-CM as a novel in vitro test system.

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>Human embryonic stem cells (hESC) are presently the stem cell type with the greatest proven capacity for producing phenotypically authentic cardiomyocytes (hESC-CM). While their use for cardiac repair faces a number of logistical problems, they are widely held to have great promise as a potential human-based <italic>in vitro</italic> cardiomyocyte model system for the cardiac researcher and the pharmaceutical industry. This potential has been enhanced by the realization that both hESC and their close cousins, the induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSC), can be obtained with disease-specific genotypes <xref rid="bb0005" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>. hESC-CM are stable in long-term culture and show relative ease of genetic manipulation compared to adult primary cardiomyocytes. Based on their gene expression patterns and electrophysiological, morphological, and contractile properties, the majority of hESC-CM initially resemble human immature cardiomyocytes but have the capacity to develop in a number of respects <xref rid="bb0010 bb0015 bb0020 bb0025" ref-type="bibr">[2–5]</xref>. Acute contractile and electrophysiological characteristics of hESC-CM show promise in terms of reflecting the adult human phenotype <xref rid="bb0020 bb0030 bb0035" ref-type="bibr">[4,6,7]</xref>, and models of arrhythmia generation have already been described <xref rid="bb0040 bb0045" ref-type="bibr">[8,9]</xref>. However, it is less obvious whether longer term responses of hypertrophy, proliferation, and apoptosis, important for both cardiac pathology studies and toxicology, would have similar fidelity.</p>
      <p>In this study, we have focused on hypertrophic responses in hESC-CM. We have used canonical inducers of both pathological and physiological hypertrophy (phenylephrine, angiotensin II, and stretch) and quantitated the output in terms of a wide range of hypertrophic markers. Importantly, we have used high-content automated microscopy to gather a number of these measurements, pointing the way towards high-throughput assays. We have interrogated the mechanism underlying the hypertrophic changes, initially using a broad screen of small molecule inhibitors for some of the most widely known hypertrophic pathways. Selecting the most active stimulus/inhibitor combination, we have verified the result using overexpression of upstream activators or dominant-negative constructs and downregulation using siRNA. Our results form a basis for the use of hESC-CM as a hypertrophic model system for cardiac research and drug discovery/toxicology.</p>

        <title>Differentiation and isolation of human embryonic stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes</title>
        <p>Cardiomyocytes were derived from human ESC line H7, which was grown on Matrigel (BD Sciences)-coated plates with daily changes of mouse embryonic fibroblast (MEF)-conditioned medium, supplemented with 8 ng/ml recombinant basic human fibroblast growth factor (bFGF, Invitrogen) and antibiotics (50 U/ml penicillin and 50 μg/ml streptomycin). MEFs were isolated from 13 dpc MF-1 strain mouse embryos and treated with mitomycin C (0.01 mg/ml, Sigma) at passage 4. MEF-CM was prepared from mitotically inactive MEFs by daily feeding/collecting hESC medium containing 80% KnockOut DMEM (KO-DMEM), 20% KOSR, 1 mM <sc>l</sc>-glutamine, 10 mM non-essential amino acids, antibiotics, 0.1 mM β-mercaptoethanol, and 4 ng/ml bFGF (all from Invitrogen) for up to a week (150 ml/18.8 × 10<sup>6</sup> cells/T225 flask). Human ESC were differentiated via embryoid bodies (EBs) by mechanically breaking up the colonies after 3–10 min of collagenase IV (Invitrogen) treatment to remove spontaneously differentiated cells, followed by culturing in suspension culture in low adherence plates for 4 days in differentiation medium (hESC medium in which 20% KOSR was replaced by non-heat-inactivated foetal calf serum) <xref rid="bb0030 bb0050" ref-type="bibr">[6,10]</xref>. The EBs were plated out onto gelatine (0.5%)-coated plastic dishes, and spontaneously beating areas, which appeared from day 9 after EB formation, were microdissected from EB outgrowths at around day 30 (range 25–40 days). In some experiments, cells were isolated from beating clusters at other time points after differentiation. Differentiated hESC in T175 flasks or 10-cm culture dishes were removed from the surface by treatment with trypsin-EDTA (Sigma-Aldrich) for 5 min and collagenase IV for 10 min, counted and plated onto 96-well plates coated with 0.5% gelatin. These were grouped either as 15 to 40 days (early), 41 to 60 days (intermediate) and 61–180 days (late) after differentiation. For high-content measurements, cells were generated from dense hESC monolayers, which were treated with human recombinant Activin A (100 ng/ml, R&amp;D Systems) (day 0–1), and bone morphogenetic protein 4 (BMP4, 10 ng/ml, R&amp;D Systems) (days 1–5) in RMPI-B27 medium (Sigma) <xref rid="bb0055" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>; spontaneously beating areas appeared within 1–2 weeks after BMP4 withdrawal. Following dissociation of clusters or monolayers into single cells, cells were seeded onto gelatinized dishes and subjected to treatments after overnight attachment in differentiation medium.</p>

        <title>Use of phenylephrine, angiotensin II and cyclic mechanical stretch</title>
        <p>To determine the effect of hypertrophic G-protein-coupled receptor agonists, hESC-CM were incubated in differentiation medium containing 10 μM α-adrenergic phenylephrine or 1 μM angiotensin II (both Sigma) for 48 h. In separate sets of experiment, cultures of isolated hESC-CM were exposed to cyclic equiaxial mechanical stretch in the presence of normal medium. Frequency of cyclic stretch was 0.5 Hz with pulsation of 10–25% elongation of cells for 24 h. Cells were stretched by applying a cyclic vacuum suction under Bioflex plates with computer-controlled equipment (FX-2000; Flexcell International). Control cultures remained on the plate without stretch.</p>

        <title>Small molecule inhibitors of hypertrophy</title>
        <p>To determine the effect of protein kinase inhibition on growth in cell size and proliferation, selective small molecule p38 inhibitor SB202190 (1 μM, Sigma), PKG inhibitor KT5823 (1 μM), HDAC II inhibitor trichostatin A (0.25 μM), ERK inhibitor PD98059 (10 μM), JNK inhibitor SP600125 (1 μM), GSK3β inhibitor 1-azakenpaullone (10 μM), CaMK II inhibitor KN93 (10 μM), calcineurin inhibitor cyclosporine A (0.2 μM), mTOR inhibitor rapamycin (10 ng/ml), and calcineurin/FKBP inhibitor FK506 (0.1 μM) were administered to hESC-CM in the presence of absence of phenylephrine for 48 h. The effect of phenylephrine was also tested in the presence of cell cycle inhibitors: myosin II inhibitor blebbistatin (10 μM, for 48 h) and synthetic anti-tubulin agent nocodazole (50 ng/ml, for 6 h). DMSO was used as control and did not affect cell size.</p>

        <title>Targeting of p38–MAPK by dominant negative p38–MAPK and constitutively active MAP2K3b adenoviruses and p38 siRNA knockdown</title>
        <p>For further characterization of p38–MAPK effects, we overexpressed a dominant-negative form of p38α (p38αDN, a gift from Dr. Yibin Wang) or constitutively active MAP2K3b (a gift from Dr. Michael Marber) in hESC-CM. p38α DN was mutated in its dual phosphorylation site (from T-G-Y to A-G-F), causing lack of kinase activity. Cells were infected on day 1 in culture by adding titered adenovirus to the culture medium at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 4 or greater. The gene transfer efficiency of cultures was determined through parallel infections with GFP adenovirus (Ad-CMV-GFP). For siRNA knockdown, p38 siRNA (Ambion Silencer pre-designed MAPK14, s3586, Applied Biosystems) transfection was performed using Oligofectamine reagent (Invitrogen, 1 μl/well, final incubation volume 50 μl) per manufacturer's instructions. Scrambled siRNA and mock transfection were used as negative controls.</p>

        <p>Cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde, permeabilized with 0.2% Triton X-100, and labeled with anti-cardiac specific troponin I (cTnI, Santa Cruz, 1:200 dilution), anti-Ki67 (proliferation marker, Abcam, 1:100), anti-p38–MAPK (A-12, Santa Cruz, 1:100), anti-atrial natriuretic factor (ANF, a marker of hypertrophy, Santa Cruz, 1:300), Rhodamine–phalloidin (Invitrogen, 1:500), mTOR (Abcam, 1:100), anti-sarcomeric myosin heavy chain (MF20, Hybridoma Bank, 1:200), and anti-myosin heavy chain α/β (MHC α/β, clone 3-48, Abcam, 1:200) primary antibodies. Primary antibodies were detected with FITC- (Abcam), Alexa 488- (Invitrogen), Alexa 546- (Invitrogen), and Cy5- (Abcam) conjugated secondary antibodies (all 1:400). DNA was visualized with DAPI (0.5 μg/ml; Sigma). Images were acquired on Zeiss Axio Observer Z1 fluorescence microscopy.</p>

        <title>Plate imaging</title>
        <p>Combinations of immunocytochemistry markers were used to further characterize detailed phenotypic properties of hESC-CM culture. The hESC-CM cultures were dissociated into individual cells before treatment and plated at low density (up to 5000 cells per well of a 96-well plate). Plates were scanned on ArrayScan™ VTi automated microscopy and image analysis system (Cellomics Inc., Pittsburgh, PA, USA) using modified Target Activation, Cell Cycle, Morphology Explorer and Compartmental Analysis BioApplication protocols. Using the system of automated highly sensitive fluorescence imaging microscope with 10× objective and suitable filter sets, the stained cells were identified with DAPI in fluorescence channel 1, cTnI- or MHC α/β-Alexa 488 in channel 2 and ANF-, and Ki67-Alexa546 in channel 3, respectively. The arbitrary value calculated from the standard deviation of the intensity of the pixels under the channel measuring DAPI reflected the content of the intact and fragmented DNA. The maximal ratio of the MHC-positive cells versus the whole differentiated hESC population was 45.4 ± 3.5% (from <italic>n</italic> = 15 experiments, the average ratio was 20.4 ± 3.3%, e.g., <xref rid="f0005" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>A). An approximate estimate showed that ~ 4 × 10<sup>5</sup> initial undifferentiated ESC (after expansion and differentation) produced ~ 6 × 10<sup>4</sup> hESC-CM. From each well, 1000–1500 total cells were analyzed, giving a minimum of 100 cardiomyocytes (and on average, 2–300). Each treatment was tested in triplicate wells, and the experiments were repeated 3 times, except where indicated. Mean average intensities and percentage of responders (those objects deemed 2 standard deviations brighter than the average of the control cells) were recorded.</p>

        <p>Undifferentiated and differentiated hESC cultures were lysed in RLT buffer for total RNA extraction as per manufacturer's protocol (Qiagen, CA). Total RNA was obtained from human left ventricular tissue explanted during transplant surgery. The RNA was purified using RNeasy columns (Qiagen, CA), quantified, and checked for quality on a denaturing 1% agarose gel. To generate double-stranded cDNA, 1 μg of total RNA was used for RT<sup>2</sup> First Strand Kit (SABiosciences, MD) or High Capacity cDNA Reverse Transcription Kit (Applied Biosystems, CA), according to published protocols.</p>

        <p>For quantifying mRNA levels of ANF, p38–MAPK, αMHC, βMHC, SERCA2a, and the ryanodine receptor2 in differentiated hESC cultures, real-time PCR analyses were performed with TaqMan Gene Expression Assays (Hs00383230_g1, Hs01047706_m1, Hs00411887_m1, Hs01110632_m1, Hs01566028_g1, and Hs00892842_m1, respectively, Applied Biosystems, CA). GAPDH Endogenous Control (FAM/MGB probe) was used as a housekeeping control. For PCR array, the cDNA was hybridized in a 96-well format against the Gene Array PAHS-018 with RT<sup>2</sup> qPCR Master Mix, which contained SYBR green dye (RT<sup>2</sup> Profiler™ PCR Array System, SABiosciences) as per the manufacturer's instructions. The array contains primers for ELK1, FOS (c-Fos), JUN, and NFκB. The PCR was performed with ABI 5700 (Applied Biosystems) and Rotor-Gene 3000 (Corbett Research) real-time PCR instruments, and the relative expression was determined by ΔΔCt method in which fold increase = 2<sup>−ΔΔCt</sup>.</p>

        <title>Phenylephrine, cyclic stretch, and angiotensin II induce cellular hypertrophy of hESC-CM</title>
        <p>Next we investigated the effects of putative hypertrophic stimuli on hESC-CM. Administration of an α-adrenoceptor/Gq agonist phenylephrine (PE, for 48 h) resulted in a significant increase in cell area (1.8-fold, <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.0001), number of hESC-CM with organized sarcomere structure (3.8-fold, <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.0001), and perinuclear immunoreactive ANF intensities (2.1-fold, <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.001) and ANF mRNA (<xref rid="f0010" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>C).

Administration of PE resulted in a cytoskeletal rearrangement such as altered cellular distribution of F-actin, indicative of myofibril thin filaments (as well as stress fiber formation) (<xref rid="f0010" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>BC). Total cellular protein to DNA content was significantly higher in PE-treated cells (7-fold higher for the whole culture by Nanodrop, and 2.1-fold higher, <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.0001, <italic>n</italic> = 55, for MHC-positive cells, <xref rid="f0010" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>C).

        <title>Small molecule hypertrophy inhibitors decreases cell size in hESC-CM</title>
        <p>To identify the canonical hypertrophy pathways mediating effects of PE, we treated hESC-CM with small molecule protein kinase inhibitors for 48 h. Comparison with PE alone showed significant differences in cell size after inhibition of p38–MAPK (SB202190), HDAC II (trichostatin A), ERK (PD98059), JNK (SP600125), CaMK II (KN93), mTOR (rapamycin), calcineurin (cyclosporine A), and calcineurin/FKBP (FK506) (<xref rid="f0020" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref>A). A further analysis additionally comparing control hESC-CM size revealed that there remained significant differences after ERK, JNK, and CaMK II inhibition, indicating that PE-induced growth was not completely abolished. Inhibition of PKG (KT5823) and GSK3β (1-azakenpaullone) had no significant effect on cell size in PE groups (<italic>P =</italic> 0.06 and 0.7, respectively), and these remained significantly increased compared to DMSO control. Inhibition of p38–MAPK, calcineurin, and mTOR also reduced basal cell size in the absence of PE (<italic>P &lt;</italic> 0.05). The majority of inhibitors reduced PE-induced increase in ANF mRNA levels, although levels were too variable to distinguish the strength of individual effects (<xref rid="f0020" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref>B).

        <title>Effect of p38–MAPK inhibition on hESC-CM growth</title>
        <p>The p38 MAPK inhibitor SB202190 showed the strongest inhibition of spontaneous cell growth (which may be driven by serum or the continuous beating) and reduced the effects of PE. Similarly, the cyclic stretch-induced increase in cell size and sarcomere alignment were abolished by SB202190 (<italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.001) (<xref rid="ec0010" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. 2AB</xref>). We therefore used more stringent methods to confirm the role of p38–MAPK in basal cell growth and PE-induced hypertrophy of hESC-CM. We found that the mRNA levels of p38–MAPK were strongly upregulated in differentiated cultures (up to 26,000-fold, <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.0001 vs hESC). In addition to earlier microarray surveys of differentiating hESC <xref rid="bb0015 bb0090" ref-type="bibr">[3,18]</xref>, our quantitative RT-PCR array showed that differentiation was associated with a transient upregulation of proximal regulatory kinases of p38–MAPK such as MAP2K3 (1.4-fold, <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.01). Silencing of p38–MAPK by siRNA abolished PE-induced increase in cell size (<italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.001) (<xref rid="f0025" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref>A). Inhibition of p38–MAPK had tonic effects to decrease hESC-CM size even in the absence of added hypertrophic stimuli (<xref rid="ec0015" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. 3A</xref>). Administration of either SB202190 or SB203580, another inhibitor with different specificity and off-target effects, caused a modest elongation of the cells (+ 7% and + 11% vs. control hESC-CM, respectively, <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.05) (<xref rid="ec0015" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. 3B</xref>). Beating rate of hESC-CM was similar in all groups (<italic>P</italic> = 0.85) (<xref rid="ec0015" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. 3C</xref>). Similarly, infection of hESC-CM with a dominant-negative form of p38α lacking kinase activity decreased cell size after 48 h (at MOI: 5, by 29 ± 5% vs. GFP adenovirus-infected cells, <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.001) (<xref rid="ec0015" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. 3A</xref>) although without changing shape (<italic>P</italic> = 0.80) (<xref rid="ec0015" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. 3B</xref>).

        <title>Constitutively active MAP2K3 induces hypertrophic growth of hESC-CM</title>
        <p>To investigate directly the effects of activating p38–MAPK, we infected hESC-CM with recombinant adenovirus expressing a constitutively active form of the upstream activator MAP2K3b (<xref rid="f0025" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref>B). Infection resulted in an increased cell size, significantly higher percentage of hESC-CM with organized sarcomeres, cytoskeletal rearrangement (all <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.0001 vs. GFP adenovirus-infected cells, 48 h), elongation of the cells (+ 12% vs. GFP control, <italic>P</italic> = 0.02), and induced ANF mRNA levels (1.7-fold, <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.05). Furthermore, constitutive activation of MAP2K3b resulted in formation of binuclear hESC-CM (relative increase in binuclear hESC-CM percentage at 2 MOI: 4-fold, 5 MOI: 2.8-fold, and 10 MOI: 2.1-fold vs. GFP control, all <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.001). This together suggests that hESC-CM infected with constitutively active MAP2K3b are undergoing cellular hypertrophy.

        <title>Phenylephrine regulates cell size independently of cell cycle</title>
        <p>To investigate whether the effect of hypertrophic agonist PE on cell size can be dissected from cell cycle checkpoints, hESC-CM were treated with cell cycle inhibitors. At 30 days after differentiation, the ratio of Ki67-positive hESC-CM was similar in PE-treated and control cells (<italic>P</italic> = 0.34), suggesting that PE did not modulate proliferative capacity. Administration of blebbistatin, a myosin class II inhibitor, blocked cytokinesis of proliferating hESC-CM, resulting in formation of binuclear cells (<xref rid="f0030" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6</xref>AC). Blebbistatin augmented the PE-induced increase in cell size (<italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.01, <xref rid="f0030" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6</xref>B). The percentage of Ki67-positive hESC-CM was similar in the control and blebbistatin-treated cultures, whereas blebbistatin increased Ki67 labeling in PE-treated cells (<xref rid="f0030" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6</xref>D). As assessed by Arrayscan analysis, the distribution of cells in G<sub>2</sub>/M and G<sub>1</sub>/G<sub>0</sub> cell cycle phases in the control and blebbistatin-treated cultures was comparable (<xref rid="f0030" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6</xref>E).

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>We have demonstrated that hESC-CM undergo growth either spontaneously with prolonged time in culture or more markedly after the canonical physiological or pathological stimuli, phenylephrine (PE), angiotensin II, or stretch. Use of increase in cellular area as a marker was supported by similar increases in volume and protein/DNA ratio. Modest changes in length/width ratio were occasionally observed, but it is not surprising that the adult elongated cardiomyocyte morphology did not develop in the absence of an anisotropic stimulus. Relating this to current models of hypertrophy, further effects observed were an increase in the number of hESC-CM with organized sarcomeric structures and a rearrangement in cytoskeletal organization. Despite significant basal levels, hypertrophic stimuli produced a marked increase in ANF in early-stage hESC-CM. A variety of interventions demonstrated the independence of the effects on growth from those on cell cycle progression. The range of morphological and expression markers that are altered in response to the <italic>G</italic><sub>q</sub> agonists and stretch was well matched between hESC-CM and rat neonatal cardiomyocyte models <xref rid="bb0095" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>.</p>
      <p>An initial broad sweep of the major pathways implicated in hypertrophy was made using small molecule inhibitors at optimal concentrations taken from literature on current rat and mouse models. This is an equivalent strategy to current medium- or high-throughput industry screens to generate initial targets. Complete inhibition of PE-induced cell size change was seen with inhibitors of p38–MAPK and calcineurin/FKBP and mTOR. p38–MAPK and calcineurin were also implicated in spontaneous development, since inhibitors decreased cell size in the absence of PE. Inhibitors of HDAC II, ERK, JNK, and CaMK II reduced PE effects but did not completely abolish them. Differences could be concentration-related: typically the more complex screens will use a range of inhibitor concentrations to determine IC<sub>50</sub> values and so assess specificity and maximum response. PKG or GSK3β inhibitors had no effect on basal or PE-induced increases in hESC-CM size: it is interesting that neither demonstrated the potentiation of PE effects that might be expected given the role of these pathways in opposing hypertrophy <xref rid="bb0100 bb0105" ref-type="bibr">[20,21]</xref>.</p>
      <p>We went on to verify the observations from the broad screen, which had identified the p38 MAPK inhibitor as most potent in reducing basal and PE-induced cell growth. The role of p38–MAPK in the spontaneous increase in hESC-CM size in culture was confirmed by an additional pharmacological inhibitor and adenoviral transfection of a dominant-inhibitory form of p38–MAPK. We further showed that infection with recombinant adenovirus containing constitutively active form of upstream MAP2K3b resulted in an increased cell size, sarcomere and cytoskeletal assembly, elongation of the cells, and induction of ANF mRNA levels. Of note, the ratio of binuclear hESC-CM was significantly higher in the constitutive active MAP2K3b group. siRNA knockdown of p38–MAPK inhibited PE-induced effects on cell size. These characteristics strongly suggest that active p38–MAPK signaling causes hypertrophic growth of hESC-CM in vitro. The p38–MAPK pathway fulfils a number of roles, which change with development in hESC, since it has been implicated in the direction of differentiation to favor cardiomyogenesis <xref rid="bb0110 bb0115 bb0120" ref-type="bibr">[22–24]</xref> and previous studies indicated the presence of p38–MAPK in hESC as well as in differentiating embryoid bodies <xref rid="bb0120 bb0125" ref-type="bibr">[24,25]</xref>. However, the involvement of p38–MAPK in hypertrophic remodeling has been controversial. Reduction of hypertrophy by small molecule inhibitors of p38–MAPK has been seen in various rat, mouse, and hamster models <xref rid="bb0130 bb0135 bb0140" ref-type="bibr">[26–28]</xref>, but transgenic manipulation has not generally supported such a role (though the embryonic lethality from p38α knockout has made these experiments technically difficult) <xref rid="bb0145" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref>.</p>
      <p>When results differ in this way between animal models and hESC-CM/iPSC-CM, with their human genetic background, it will be interesting to see how the balance of evidence is weighed. One reason for differences may be the immature phenotype of the hESC-CM especially at early time points. In the present study, we showed that expression of myosin heavy chain isoforms, SERCA2, and ryanodine receptor 2 increased strongly 2 months after differentiation of hESCs. These changes would tend to be associated with maturation, and this is approximately the duration over which other indicators of development are seen, such as upregulation of repolarization-related K<sup>+</sup> channels, resistance to arrhythmias, and development of intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> stores <xref rid="bb0020" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>. However, the immaturity of hESC-CM must remain a significant caveat.</p>
      <p>Obviously, we have not been exhaustive in exploring all the known hypertrophic pathways and have not even considered those newly identified from genomic, transcriptomic, or proteomic arrays. However, it is clear from both this study and the wealth of literature <xref rid="bb0150 bb0155" ref-type="bibr">[30,31]</xref> that there are multiple interacting pathways controlling aspects of hypertrophy. Numerous reviews show the interconnections and redundancy of the control systems and the emergent properties that arise from these complex relations <xref rid="bb0160 bb0165" ref-type="bibr">[32,33]</xref>. The challenge is now to apply network systems biology to identify key control points that coordinate multiple signal inputs and then produce graded outputs of cardiac growth <xref rid="bb0170" ref-type="bibr">[34]</xref>. The techniques and data described here show that one advantage of hESC-CM is their suitability for high-throughput methodologies, which will match functional cellular outputs to array-generated information. An exciting aspect of hESC-CM or iPSC-CM is the ability to compare cells directly with individual patient responses for particular mutations or haplotypes. For example, iPSC-CM have recently been generated from patients with LEOPARD syndrome, which include a hypertrophic phenotype <xref rid="bb0175" ref-type="bibr">[35]</xref>. <italic>In vitro</italic> these iPSC-derived cardiomyocytes had a greater cell size, more sarcomeric organization, and high nuclear NFATC4 than controls, although ANF, protein/DNA ratio and volume were not assessed. Efforts such as these, as well as the comparisons being undertaken by pharmaceutical industries for clinical predictivity of hESC-CM, relative to current <italic>in vivo</italic> and in vitro screens, will allow an understanding of the fidelity of response of hESC-CM to adult heart. Ultimately, only clinical trials can assess whether a given model has been of use in predicting compounds that will be effective against human disease.</p>

      <title>Conclusions</title>
      <p>HESC-CM have continued capacity to increase in size after differentiation, and growth is stimulated by classical physiological and pathological hypertrophic agents. Effects of small molecule inhibitors indicated the involvement a number of known hypertrophic pathways in this process, including p38–MAPK, calcineurin, FKBP, mTOR, HDAC II, ERK, JNK, and CaMK II. These results represent the basis for development of hESC-CM as a tool for the cardiac researcher or pharmaceutical industry, while the methodologies used may lead to high-throughput small molecule or RNAi screens to investigate hypertrophic and anti-hypertrophic responses. Establishment of the phenotypic fidelity of hESC-CM and their subsequent incorporation into humanized, high-throughput, genotype-specific models could produce a step change in productivity for the cardiac researcher.</p>
