        <title>Summary</title>
        <p>During transcript elongation in vitro, backtracking of RNA polymerase II (RNAPII) is a frequent occurrence that can lead to transcriptional arrest. The polymerase active site can cleave the transcript during such backtracking, allowing transcription to resume. Transcript cleavage is either stimulated by elongation factor TFIIS or occurs much more slowly in its absence. However, whether backtracking actually occurs in vivo, and whether transcript cleavage is important to escape it, has been unclear. Using a yeast TFIIS mutant that lacks transcript cleavage stimulatory activity and simultaneously inhibits unstimulated cleavage, we now provide evidence that escape from backtracking via transcript cleavage is essential for cell viability and efficient transcript elongation. Our results suggest that transcription problems leading to backtracking are frequent in vivo and that reactivation of backtracked RNAPII is crucial for transcription.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>RNA polymerase II (RNAPII) is responsible for transcription of all protein-encoding genes and a large number of stable and unstable noncoding RNAs in eukaryotes. Interestingly, during transcript elongation RNAPII moves by Brownian motion rather than by the ATP-driven powerstrokes typical of DNA helicases (<xref rid="bib6 bib25" ref-type="bibr">Bar-Nahum et al., 2005; Nudler, 2009</xref>). This means that although it moves rapidly forward on average, the polymerase can also perform retrograde motion (backtracking). Indeed, transcript elongation by RNAPII in vitro is known to be a highly discontinuous process, involving frequent pausing, backtracking, and transcriptional arrest, and a plethora of elongation factors are required to stimulate its progression (<xref rid="bib31 bib3 bib9 bib39" ref-type="bibr">Reines et al., 1999; Arndt and Kane, 2003; Galburt et al., 2007; Svejstrup, 2007</xref>).</p>
      <p>The accessory factor TFIIS (also called SII) reactivates backtracked elongation complexes by directing transcript cleavage—by RNAPII—which serves to realign the polymerase active site with the new RNA transcript end so that transcription can continue (<xref rid="bib15 bib30" ref-type="bibr">Izban and Luse, 1992; Reines, 1992</xref>). As a result, TFIIS action can result in dramatic enhancement of overall transcription in reconstituted transcription reactions (<xref rid="bib36 bib29 bib7 bib16" ref-type="bibr">Sekimizu et al., 1976; Reinberg and Roeder, 1987; Bengal et al., 1991; Jeon et al., 1994</xref>). TFIIS can be detected on the coding region of active genes in vivo (<xref rid="bib28 bib10" ref-type="bibr">Pokholok et al., 2002; Ghavi-Helm et al., 2008</xref>), but often only when transcription is compromised, for example by nucleotide depletion (<xref rid="bib28" ref-type="bibr">Pokholok et al., 2002</xref>). The apparently discontinuous nature of transcript elongation in vitro makes it surprising that the single gene encoding TFIIS (called <italic>DST1</italic>, or <italic>PPR2</italic>) is not essential in yeast (<xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr">Hubert et al., 1983</xref>) and that the consequences of its absence for the efficiency of transcript elongation even through a long gene appear to be relatively minor (<xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr">Mason and Struhl, 2005</xref>). This could imply that transcription is a much more smooth, continuous process in vivo than it is in vitro (i.e., that backtracking rarely occurs inside cells under normal conditions), so that transcript cleavage and escape from arrest are not important. Alternatively, the ability to escape backtracking by using the slower, intrinsic (uncatalyzed) transcript cleavage activity of RNAPII might be important and sufficient for transcription and cell viability in the absence of TFIIS. Here, we report on a study aimed at assessing the importance of transcript cleavage for transcript elongation, in vitro and in vivo. Our results indicate that transcript cleavage is essential for transcription and cell viability.</p>

        <title>A TFIIS Mutant that Inhibits Intrinsic Transcript Cleavage In Vitro</title>
        <p>The highly conserved acidic loop in TFIIS interacts with the active site of RNAPII to direct transcript cleavage, probably by positioning a metal ion and water to promote hydrolytic cleavage (<xref rid="bib16 bib17 bib41" ref-type="bibr">Jeon et al., 1994; Kettenberger et al., 2003; Wang et al., 2009</xref>). TFIIS-stimulated transcript cleavage depends on an Asp<sub>290</sub>-Glu<sub>291</sub> dipeptide in this loop (<xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr">Jeon et al., 1994</xref>), so in order to study the role of transcript cleavage in elongation, we changed both these residues to alanine (generating TFIIS<sub>Mut</sub>). In another mutant (TFIIS<sub>AcDel</sub>), the same residues were deleted, leading to shortening of the loop and its predicted partial withdrawal from the RNAPII active site.</p>
        <p>To study the effect of the mutations on TFIIS-stimulated transcript cleavage, reconstituted RNAPII elongation complexes containing a radioactively labeled 12-mer RNA were incubated for different times before analysis of the RNA by denaturing PAGE (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>A). On this substrate (in the absence of NTPs), RNAPII spontaneously backtracks, allowing transcript cleavage to be detected. Even in the absence of TFIIS, slow but easily detectable cleavage activity was observed in this assay (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>A, lanes 2–5). This cleavage was not due to contamination of the highly purified RNAPII preparation with TFIIS, as polymerase purified from <italic>dst1</italic>Δ cells had similar activity (see <xref rid="app2" ref-type="sec">Figure S1</xref>A available online). Transcript cleavage was, however, strongly stimulated by wild-type TFIIS, with full-length RNA in the elongation complex disappearing quickly (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>A, lanes 6–9). As expected, TFIIS<sub>Mut</sub> failed to stimulate transcript cleavage but, surprisingly, instead actually inhibited the intrinsic RNAPII transcript cleavage reaction (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>A, lanes 10–13). TFIIS<sub>AcDel</sub> also failed to stimulate transcript cleavage but in contrast to TFIIS<sub>Mut</sub> did not significantly affect intrinsic RNAPII transcript cleavage (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>A, compare lanes 14–17 with 2–5). We speculate that TFIIS<sub>AcDel</sub> has lost the ability to direct the correct placement of a metal ion and water to promote hydrolytic cleavage, while TFIIS<sub>Mut</sub> has not only lost this ability but at the same time inhibits the intrinsic cleavage reaction (which is thought to occur via a different mechanism [<xref rid="bib41" ref-type="bibr">Wang et al., 2009</xref>]).</p>
        <p>Because the insertion of TFIIS's hairpin loop into the active site of RNAPII results in the rearrangements of protein-RNA interactions (<xref rid="bib41" ref-type="bibr">Wang et al., 2009</xref>), TFIIS<sub>Mut</sub> might also conceivably affect intrinsic transcript cleavage indirectly, by binding and fixating RNAPII in a configuration which is not conducive to transcript cleavage. However, in agreement with previous reports showing that binding to RNAPII is independent of TFIIS's C-terminal acidic loop (part of TFIIS domain III) but requires domain II (<xref rid="bib5 bib17" ref-type="bibr">Awrey et al., 1998; Kettenberger et al., 2003</xref>), we found no evidence for a difference in the overall binding affinity of TFIIS<sub>Mut</sub> for RNAPII elongation complexes (<xref rid="app2" ref-type="sec">Figure S1</xref>B). The TFIIS mutants also failed to affect transcription to the end of a short, easily transcribed DNA substrate on which no significant transcription pause/arrest sites are detected under normal conditions (precluding transcriptional arrest and the need for transcript cleavage) (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>B), indicating that neither mutant significantly affects the process of nucleotide addition either.</p>
        <p>This conclusion was further supported by an experiment in which it was additionally investigated whether TFIIS<sub>Mut</sub> might be pushing RNAPII back or fixating it in the backtracked state. In this experiment (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>C), RNAPII elongation complexes were preincubated on ice for 10–15 min in transcription buffer (TB) without TFIIS, or in the presence of TFIIS<sub>Mut</sub> or TFIIS<sub>AcDel</sub>. Previous experiments had shown that substantial transcript cleavage takes place already within 5 min of incubation with wild-type TFIIS under these conditions (data not shown), showing that RNAPII moves backward and forward on this substrate and can be “caught” by TFIIS in the backtracked state. After preincubation, GTP was added (time = 0), allowing chain elongation at low temperature. All starting material was rapidly converted to extended product, with no significant difference observed in the presence of TFIIS<sub>Mut</sub> (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>C, compare lanes 2–3 with 5 and 6, and 8 and 9), indicating that this TFIIS mutant does not drive backtracking, immobilize RNAPII in a backtracked position, or inhibit nucleotide addition.</p>
      </sec>
      <sec id="sec2.2">
        <title>TFIIS<sub>Mut</sub> Inhibits Transcription through Pause Sites</title>
        <p>Hoping that TFIIS<sub>Mut</sub> would be useful for studying what happens when both types of transcript cleavage activity are inhibited, we proceeded to further characterize its effect on a transcription template containing an adenine tract, which acts as a potent pause site (<xref rid="bib33" ref-type="bibr">Saeki and Svejstrup, 2009</xref>). Transcription of this substrate results in substantial polymerase stalling and backtracking and therefore a need for transcript cleavage for efficient readthrough. Only a relatively small fraction of RNAPII was capable of transcribing through the tract (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>A, lanes 1–3), but the addition of wild-type TFIIS resulted in an increase in full-length product, with the majority of RNAPII reaching the end of the template at high nucleotide concentration (lanes 5 and 6). The addition of TFIIS<sub>AcDel</sub> had no such effect (lanes 7–9), suggesting that stimulated transcript cleavage was responsible for the increase in A/T tract readthrough observed with wild-type TFIIS. In contrast, addition of TFIIS<sub>Mut</sub> had an inhibitory effect: compared to RNAPII alone (or in the presence of TFIIS<sub>AcDel</sub>), fewer RNAPII molecules now reached the end of the template (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>A, compare lanes 10–12 with 1–3 and 7–9). Since TFIIS<sub>Mut</sub> inhibits intrinsic transcript cleavage, this result is consistent with the idea that intrinsic transcript cleavage has a positive effect on transcription through the A/T tract by allowing reactivation of backtracked elongation complexes.</p>
        <p>This conclusion was further supported by the use of the nucleotide analog 3′-<italic>O</italic>-methyl-GTP, which acts as a transcript chain terminator. Elongation complexes having incorporated this nucleotide in the transcript cannot continue transcription unless the analog is removed by transcript cleavage (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>B, schematic). On the DNA template whose transcription was otherwise unaffected by the different forms of TFIIS (see <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>B), wild-type TFIIS increased transcription from chain-terminated transcripts, but even without addition of TFIIS considerable transcript cleavage-dependent transcription occurred (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>B, compare lanes 3 and 4). Significantly, while the addition of TFIIS<sub>AcDel</sub> had little or no effect on such transcription, TFIIS<sub>Mut</sub> significantly inhibited it (compare lane 5 with lanes 4 and 6).</p>
        <p>Together, these results further support the idea that TFIIS<sub>Mut</sub> reduces transcription by inhibiting transcript cleavage, rather than by inhibiting nucleotide addition, pushing RNAPII back, or fixating it in the backtracked state.</p>

        <title>TFIIS<sub>Mut</sub> Inhibits Transcript Elongation through a Long Gene In Vitro</title>
        <p>The data presented above indicate that TFIIS<sub>Mut</sub> inhibits the reactivation of RNAPII elongation complexes undergoing transcriptional arrest at individual artificial pause or blockage sites. Obviously, during transcript elongation through a normal, much longer gene, even a modest inhibitory effect on individual cleavage events (such as that observed in <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>A, lanes 10–13) could have a great effect overall. If inhibition of the individual cleavage event were 2-fold, for example, the fold overall inhibition of transcription would thus be 2<sup>N</sup> (where N is the number of cleavage events). We therefore now tested the effect of TFIIS<sub>Mut</sub> on promoter-specific transcription in crude cell-free yeast extracts (<xref rid="bib35 bib20" ref-type="bibr">Schultz et al., 1991; Kong and Svejstrup, 2002</xref>). The DNA template in these experiments contained an RNAPII promoter driving transcription through two G-less cassettes separated by ∼1500 nucleotides (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>, upper panel), and has previously been used to investigate the effect of different factors on transcript elongation (<xref rid="bib22 bib32" ref-type="bibr">Lee and Greenleaf, 1997; Rondon et al., 2003</xref>). Treatment of the resulting transcripts with RNase T1 (which cleaves at G residues) results in the elimination of RNA surrounding these cassettes, so that the relative efficiency of transcription close to the promoter (proximal cassette) and far from it (distal cassette) can be evaluated. Even in the absence of TFIIS (extract from <italic>dst1</italic>Δ cells was used), transcription through both cassettes was observed (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>, lanes 1, 4, and 7), but addition of wild-type TFIIS enhanced transcript elongation, so that approximately 40% of the polymerases that transcribed the proximal cassette also passed through the distal cassette (versus ∼22% in its absence) (lanes 2 and 3). In contrast, TFIIS<sub>Mut</sub> severely inhibited elongation, with much fewer polymerases (∼1%) also making it through to the distal cassette (lanes 5 and 6). TFIIS<sub>AcDel</sub> had little effect (lanes 8 and 9). Note that TFIIS also plays positive roles in the transcription cycle prior to transcript elongation, some of which are independent of its transcript cleavage activity (<xref rid="bib42 bib1 bib11 bib19" ref-type="bibr">Wery et al., 2004; Adelman et al., 2005; Guglielmi et al., 2007; Kim et al., 2007</xref>). This might explain the stimulation of transcription observed through the short proximal cassette observed with the different versions of TFIIS, including TFIIS<sub>Mut</sub>.</p>
      </sec>
      <sec id="sec2.4">
        <title>Expression of TFIIS<sub>Mut</sub> Is Lethal in Yeast</title>
        <p>The data presented above suggest that TFIIS<sub>Mut</sub> significantly affects the ability of RNAPII to escape transcriptional arrest via inhibition of transcript cleavage. We therefore reasoned that TFIIS<sub>Mut</sub> would provide a unique tool for investigating the relevance of these processes for transcription in vivo, which has not previously been feasible. The <italic>DST1</italic> gene is nonessential (<xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr">Hubert et al., 1983</xref>), and though <italic>dst1</italic>Δ cells are 6-azauracil (6AU) sensitive (6AU depletes nucleotide pools and inhibits elongation [<xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">Exinger and Lacroute, 1992</xref>]), they have no significant growth defects under normal conditions (see below). Nevertheless, when a <italic>CEN</italic> (single-copy) plasmid encoding TFIIS<sub>Mut</sub> was transformed into a <italic>dst1</italic>Δ strain, we repeatedly failed to obtain a significant number of viable colonies, while numerous colonies were obtained with wild-type control plasmid and vector alone (<xref rid="app2" ref-type="sec">Figure S3</xref>A; data not shown).</p>
        <p>Expression of wild-type TFIIS, TFIIS<sub>Mut</sub>, and TFIIS<sub>AcDel</sub> was therefore now put under control of the inducible <italic>GAL</italic> promoter. As expected, no effect on cell growth was observed with any of these constructs under repressing conditions (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>A, “glucose”). Moreover, while expression of wild-type TFIIS rescued the 6AU sensitivity of <italic>dst1</italic>Δ cells, expression of TFIIS<sub>AcDel</sub> did not, and its expression had no effect on growth (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>A; “galactose + 6AU,” and “galactose,” respectively). In marked contrast, cells expressing TFIIS<sub>Mut</sub> failed to grow on galactose (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>A), and TFIIS<sub>Mut</sub> even functioned as a dominant-negative, strongly inhibiting growth when expressed in <italic>DST1</italic> (WT) cells (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>D). The fact that TFIIS<sub>AcDel</sub> (which abolishes TFIIS-mediated transcript cleavage stimulation but does not inhibit intrinsic RNAPII transcript cleavage) is not lethal to cells is important, as it correlates the inhibition of transcript cleavage with inhibition of cell growth.</p>
        <p>We observed that viable cells could be obtained if they simultaneously expressed TFIIS<sub>Mut</sub> (from the <italic>DST1</italic> promoter) and overexpressed wild-type TFIIS (from the <italic>GAL</italic> promoter) (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>B, “galactose”). However, these cells ceased growing when replated on glucose (on which overexpression of wild-type TFIIS ceased, so that only physiological levels of TFIIS<sub>Mut</sub> were maintained) (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>B, “glucose”), further showing that TFIIS<sub>Mut</sub> causes growth cessation.</p>
        <p>In the absence of the nonessential Rpb9 subunit, TFIIS-directed transcript cleavage and transcription through pause sites are significantly affected (<xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">Awrey et al., 1997</xref>; see also <xref rid="app2" ref-type="sec">Figure S3</xref>B), and <italic>rpb9</italic> cells have phenotypes consistent with a role for the subunit in transcript elongation (<xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr">Hemming et al., 2000</xref>). It has been reported that TFIIS binds to RNAPII in an Rpb9-independent manner (<xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">Awrey et al., 1997</xref>). However, previous studies used “free” RNAPII, not RNAPII elongation complexes, for such binding experiments. Using reconstituted elongation complexes, we found that normal interaction of RNAPII with TFIIS requires the Rpb9 subunit (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>C, compare lanes 3–6 with 9–12). Besides helping to explain the well-known effect of <italic>rpb9</italic> mutation on transcript elongation and TFIIS activity, these data also allowed us to determine whether the detrimental effect of TFIIS<sub>Mut</sub> in vivo requires normal interaction with RNAPII elongation complexes. Strikingly, in <italic>rpb9</italic>Δ cells TFIIS<sub>Mut</sub> expression had virtually no deleterious effect (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>D, “galactose,” lower half; see also <xref rid="app2" ref-type="sec">Figure S3</xref>A [lower]). Moreover, point mutations in the largest RNAPII subunit, <italic>RPB1</italic> (<italic>RPO21</italic>), have been isolated that greatly affect the ability of the polymerase to bind TFIIS (<xref rid="bib43" ref-type="bibr">Wu et al., 1996</xref>). These mutants were also unaffected by TFIIS<sub>Mut</sub> expression (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>E).</p>

        <title>Expression of TFIIS<sub>Mut</sub> Inhibits Transcript Elongation In Vivo</title>
        <p>Together, the experiments described so far indicate that the activity inhibited by TFIIS<sub>Mut</sub> is intrinsic to the RNAPII elongation complex, and support the idea that RNAPII transcript cleavage and efficient escape from backtracking is required for cell growth. To more directly investigate the effect of inhibiting transcript cleavage on RNAPII transcription in vivo, we now used chromatin immunoprecipitation in <italic>dst1</italic>Δ cells to measure polymerase density across a long <italic>GAL</italic>-driven gene (<xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr">Kristjuhan and Svejstrup, 2004</xref>) (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref>A). In cells lacking TFIIS (vector), the density of RNAPII on this model gene was similar at the promoter and across the coding region. Expression of wild-type TFIIS modestly increased RNAPII density in all regions tested, while TFIIS<sub>AcDel</sub> had little or no effect. By contrast, in cells expressing TFIIS<sub>Mut</sub>, promoter recruitment was similar to that of control cells, but the density of polymerases became progressively lower through the coding region, reaching a level close to that of the nonactivated control at the end of the gene (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref>A).</p>
        <p>Although the effects were less dramatic, TFIIS<sub>Mut</sub> (but not TFIIS<sub>AcDel</sub>) expression also negatively affected transcript elongation at other genes tested, as indicated by the lower RNAPII density at the 3′ end relative to the 5′ end in these genes (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref>B). Together, these data support the idea that TFIIS<sub>Mut</sub> selectively inhibits transcript elongation in vivo.</p>

        <title>Expression of TFIIS<sub>Mut</sub> Elicits RNAPII Polyubiquitylation</title>
        <p>We previously reported that ubiquitylation/degradation of RNAPII functions as a last resort when arrested RNAPII complexes cannot otherwise be reactivated (<xref rid="bib38" ref-type="bibr">Somesh et al., 2005</xref>). Using a matrix which specifically binds ubiquitylated proteins and western blotting with RNAPII-specific antibodies to measure the level of RNAPII ubiquitylation (<xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr">Anindya et al., 2007</xref>), we found that upon expression of TFIIS<sub>Mut</sub>, but none of the other TFIIS forms, a dramatic increase in cellular RNAPII polyubiquitylation was observed (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6</xref>, compare lane 6 with lanes 2, 4, and 8). This result may explain why RNAPII does not accumulate to a higher level in the beginning of the coding region in TFIIS<sub>Mut</sub>-expressing cells (see <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref>): arrested polymerases are removed via ubiquitylation and proteasome-mediated degradation in these cells.</p>

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>Somewhat surprisingly, the gene encoding transcript cleavage stimulatory factor TFIIS is not essential for transcription or viability, suggesting that transcript cleavage is not important for transcription. However, RNAPII also has an intrinsic transcript cleavage activity, whose importance for transcription, if any, has been unclear. Here we provide evidence to support the idea that transcription obstacles resulting in RNAPII backtracking are frequent in vivo, and that the ability of RNAPII to cleave its transcript in response to such backtracking is essential for transcription and cell viability.</p>
      <p>Using a variety of in vitro assays, we found that a TFIIS double point mutant (TFIIS Asp<sub>290</sub>Ala, Glu<sub>291</sub>Ala [TFIIS<sub>Mut</sub>]) not only fails to support TFIIS-stimulated transcript cleavage but also inhibits the slow intrinsic cleavage activity of RNAPII itself. This protein inhibits transcription through artificial pause sites and dramatically decreases the efficiency of transcript elongation through a long test gene in vitro. In contrast, a control protein (TFIIS<sub>AcDel</sub>, in which Asp<sub>290</sub> and Glu<sub>291</sub> are deleted), which fails to support TFIIS-stimulated transcript cleavage, but does not inhibit the intrinsic cleavage activity of RNAPII, has virtually no effect in these transcription assays. Strikingly, when constructs expressing these proteins were studied in vivo in yeast, we found that TFIIS<sub>Mut</sub>, but not TFIIS<sub>AcDel</sub>, is lethal, and that TFIIS<sub>Mut</sub> inhibits transcript elongation and elicits dramatic RNAPII polyubiquitylation in cells.</p>
      <sec id="sec3.1">
        <title>Mechanism of TFIIS<sub>Mut</sub> Action</title>
        <p>The movement of RNA polymerases is not generated via the ATP-dependent “powerstrokes” typical of DNA helicases. Rather, it is governed by a Brownian ratchet mechanism, with one of the forward translocated states being stabilized by binding of the correct incoming nucleotide (<xref rid="bib6 bib13 bib25" ref-type="bibr">Bar-Nahum et al., 2005; Herbert et al., 2008; Nudler, 2009</xref>). One consequence of this type of mechanism is that although the polymerase moves rapidly forward on average, it also frequently moves backward. So, although the formation of a new phosphodiester bond is likely to be immediately followed by forward translocation, the enzyme can also instead backtrack for one or several nucleotides so that the 3′ RNA terminus comes out of alignment with the active site. Brownian motion can bring the end of the RNA back in register with the active site again, but the polymerase is also capable of endonucleolytic cleavage of the transcript, a process which is highly stimulated by TFIIS (<xref rid="bib15 bib30" ref-type="bibr">Izban and Luse, 1992; Reines, 1992</xref>).</p>
        <p>We found that TFIIS<sub>Mut</sub>, but not the closely related TFIIS<sub>AcDel</sub> mutant, inhibits the intrinsic ability of RNAPII to cleave its nascent transcript, and that this correlates with lethality in yeast. We also tested the possibility that TFIIS<sub>Mut</sub> might be capable of “driving” RNAPII backtracking and/or that it might be very slow to dissociate from the elongation complex, perhaps precluding RNAPII from returning (forward translocating) to the catalytically competent configuration. In this scenario, inhibition of intrinsic transcript cleavage might be an indirect effect. However, we were unable to detect any change in the RNAPII-binding characteristics of TFIIS<sub>Mut</sub> compared to wild-type, and the mutant also did not significantly affect the rate of nucleotide addition in experiments (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>C and <xref rid="app2" ref-type="sec">Figure S1</xref>B). Most importantly, transcription of a DNA template without prominent pause sites was largely unaffected by the presence of TFIIS<sub>Mut</sub> (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>B), but in the presence of a chain terminator where transcription of the same template could only be restored by transcript cleavage, TFIIS<sub>Mut</sub> significantly inhibited transcription (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>B), strongly arguing that its effect on transcript elongation is due to inhibition of transcript cleavage. Thus, although we cannot completely rule out the possibility that TFIIS<sub>Mut</sub> might under certain circumstances affect pause escape or forward translocation as well, our data are best consistent with the idea that it affects transcription and cell viability through its inability to support/allow transcript cleavage.</p>
        <p>The precise mechanism of inhibition of intrinsic transcript cleavage by TFIIS<sub>Mut</sub> remains to be resolved, but results from recent structural studies support the idea that intrinsic RNAPII transcript cleavage and TFIIS-stimulated cleavage occur via different mechanisms (<xref rid="bib41" ref-type="bibr">Wang et al., 2009</xref>). In “intrinsic cleavage mode,” the base of the backtracked nucleotide in the “P site” coordinates magnesium to facilitate transcript cleavage. By contrast, in “TFIIS-dependent cleavage mode” structural changes in the RNAPII active site upon insertion of TFIIS's acidic loop mean that the two acidic residues in the TFIIS loop tip provide the coordination of magnesium instead of the backtracked nucleotide, supporting a much more efficient way of cleavage (<xref rid="bib41" ref-type="bibr">Wang et al., 2009</xref>). It thus seems reasonable to suggest that TFIIS<sub>Mut</sub> results in structural changes to backtracked RNAPII that inhibit intrinsic transcript cleavage, but without supporting TFIIS-stimulated transcript cleavage.</p>

        <title>An Essential Role for Transcript Cleavage in Transcription and Viability</title>
        <p>The gene encoding TFIIS in yeast is dispensable for viability (<xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr">Hubert et al., 1983</xref>). Interestingly, bacteria such as <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> encode two distinct transcript cleavage stimulatory factors, GreA and GreB. However, even the <italic>greA</italic><sup>−</sup> <italic>greB</italic><sup>−</sup> double mutant is viable (<xref rid="bib26" ref-type="bibr">Orlova et al., 1995</xref>). This, as in eukaryotes, may suggest either that transcript cleavage is not important, or that the intrinsic transcript cleavage activity of RNAP suffices for bacterial transcription and survival. Our data in the eukaryotic system support the second possibility and certainly provide a likely explanation for why <italic>DST1</italic> is not an essential gene in yeast: the intrinsic transcript cleavage activity of RNAPII may suffice for transcription and survival in the absence of stimulated transcript cleavage.</p>
      </sec>
      <sec id="sec3.3">
        <title>Obstacles for Transcription Are Frequent In Vivo</title>
        <p>The evidence described here also supports the idea that transcription problems leading to transcriptional backtracking are frequent in vivo. This is most clearly indicated by the lack of polymerases making it to the end of <italic>GAL-VPS13</italic> in the presence of TFIIS<sub>Mut</sub> (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref>A). This effect is particularly striking given that transcript cleavage inhibition by TFIIS<sub>Mut</sub> is not dramatic in vitro (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>) and given that it requires direct association with elongating RNAPII (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>), meaning that, in all likelihood, transcript cleavage in only a fraction of polymerases that backtrack and require transcript cleavage can be inhibited by TFIIS<sub>Mut</sub> expression.</p>
        <p>The precise nature of the obstacles resulting in RNA backtracking is unknown, but as backtracking is an intrinsic consequence of RNAPII moving via Brownian motion rather than ATP-driven powerstrokes, it seems reasonable to expect that all kinds of obstacles, including natural pause sites, secondary DNA structures, nucleosomes, and other DNA-binding proteins, are likely to cause transcription problems and backtracking.</p>
        <p>Expression of TFIIS<sub>Mut</sub> in cells results in a dramatic increase in RNAPII polyubiquitylation. Ubiquitylation/degradation of RNAPII occurs in response to transcription obstacles, such as UV-induced DNA damage, but is also triggered by 6AU (<xref rid="bib38" ref-type="bibr">Somesh et al., 2005</xref>) and the RNAPII-specific inhibitor α-amanitin (<xref rid="bib24 bib2" ref-type="bibr">Nguyen et al., 1996; Anindya et al., 2007</xref>). It thus seems highly likely that the signal for ubiquitylation/degradation is the backtracked polymerase, and that expression of TFIIS<sub>Mut</sub> gives rise to a dramatic increase in the number of polymerases caught in this state.</p>
        <p>In summary, our data suggest that RNAPII transcript elongation in vivo is surprisingly problematic and involves frequent retrograde motion, with a constant need to rescue backtracked elongation complexes by transcript cleavage. Without efficient reactivation of such complexes, overall transcript elongation is severely compromised, with polymerases ending up “dead in their tracks” and being removed in a process at least partly dependent on RNAPII ubiquitylation/degradation.</p>

        <p>The formation of ternary complexes has been described previously (<xref rid="bib38" ref-type="bibr">Somesh et al., 2005</xref>), but in order to enrich for transcriptionally competent complexes, further purification steps were introduced in most experiments. A P<sup>32</sup>-5′-end-labeled RNA oligonucleotide (9-mer, or 12-mer, in 1:1 molar ratio) was annealed to a DNA template strand (which was biotinylated at the 3′ end). Typically, 1.5 μg RNAPII was incubated with 2.5 pmol of the DNA/RNA hybrid, followed by the addition of 5 pmol of the nontemplate DNA strand. Stable and transcriptionally active RNAPII elongation complexes were enriched by incubating in wash buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl [pH 8.0], 250 mM NaCl, 2 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>) at 30°C for 90 min, followed by binding to M2 (anti-Flag) agarose (Sigma) to isolate Flag-tagged RNAPII and remove free DNA and RNA. M2-associated RNAPII was released by once repeated incubation for 5 min at 4°C with 0.2 mg/ml “3xFlag” peptide (N-MDYKDHDGDYKDHDIDYKDDDDK-C). RNAPII incorporated into elongation complexes was then separated from free RNAPII by binding elongation complexes to streptavidin-paramagnetic beads (Promega) via the biotin tag on the template DNA strand. This was followed by three 2 min wash steps at room temperature (RT) in TB (20 mM Tris-HCl [pH 7.9], 40 mM KCl, 5 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>).

        <p>TFIIS<sub>Mut</sub> Inhibits Intrinsic Transcript Cleavage but Does Not Affect Nucleotide Addition</p>
        <p>(A) (Box) Schematic of experiment. Radioactive label is denoted by asterisk and the RNAPII active site as a filled sphere. (Lower) Characterization by denaturing PAGE of transcript cleavage in RNAPII elongation complexes assembled with a labeled 12-mer RNA oligonucleotide and then incubated with different TFIIS forms for the times indicated. Migration of full-length (12-mer) RNA and the major intrinsic cleavage product (arrow) is indicated. Quantification of transcript cleavage is shown below the autoradiograph.</p>
        <p>(B) (Box) Schematic. Nucleotides, except CTP (NTPs), allow transcription of a reconstituted RNAPII elongation complex to the first guanine (G) in the template strand. (Lower) Characterization by denaturing PAGE of transcription for 5 min from the end-labeled 9-mer RNA oligonucleotide. Wild-type TFIIS induces transcript cleavage and thereby degradation of the RNA primer in the absence of nucleotides (lane 3).</p>
        <p>(C) Nucleotide addition by RNAPII elongation complexes preincubated on ice without TFIIS, or in the presence of TFIIS<sub>Mut</sub> or TFIIS<sub>AcDel</sub>, as indicated. GTP was added to allow nucleotide addition for 5 and 10 s. Migration of bands representing starting material (9-mer) and the addition of one or two G's are indicated to the right.

        <p>TFIIS<sub>Mut</sub> Inhibits Transcript Elongation through Pause Sites</p>
        <p>(A) (Box) Schematic of experiment. A<sub>9</sub> designates 9-nucleotide A-tract (pause site). (Lower) Characterization, by denaturing PAGE, of transcription for 5 min as in <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>B, but with DNA substrate containing an A tract. FL, full-length product. Quantification of FL transcripts, relative to RNAPII alone (set to 100%), are shown below the autoradiograph where meaningful.</p>
        <p>(B) (Box) Schematic of experiment. After extension of the RNA primer with chain terminator nucleotide, transcription for 10 min with normal nucleotides is allowed to occur. Such transcription absolutely requires transcript cleavage, removing the chain terminating nucleotide (shown as filled triangle). (Lower) Characterization by denaturing PAGE of transcription reconstituted as in <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>B, but adding 3′-O-methyl-GTP (and washing it away), prior to transcription with the normal NTPs (-CTP). Quantification of the full-length transcripts, relative to RNAPII alone (lane 4, set to 100%) is shown below the autoradiograph where meaningful. Note that TFIIS actually stimulates transcription more than 2-fold (196%), but this reaction runs out of nucleotides because of repeated cycles of backtracking/transcript cleavage/forward motion at FL, resulting in some polymerases ending up backtracked from FL.

        <p>TFIIS<sub>Mut</sub> Inhibits Promoter-Driven Transcript Elongation</p>
        <p>(Box) Schematic of DNA substrate for promoter-driven transcription. Angled arrow indicates transcription start site; boxes indicate G-less cassettes of different sizes (84 and 376 nucleotides, respectively [<xref rid="bib22 bib32" ref-type="bibr">Lee and Greenleaf, 1997; Rondon et al., 2003</xref>]). (Lower) Characterization by denaturing PAGE of promoter-specific transcription reconstituted with crude WCEs from a <italic>dst1</italic>Δ strain in the absence (lanes 1, 4, and 7) and presence of the TFIIS forms indicated. Migration of the RNA bands representing transcription of the proximal (prox) and distal (dis) cassettes is indicated on the right. Quantification of transcription through the distal cassette (in percent of that observed through the proximal cassette) is shown below the autoradiograph.</p>

        <p>Inhibition of RNAPII Transcript Cleavage Has Severe Consequences for Transcript Elongation</p>
        <p>(A) (Upper) Schematic of <italic>GAL-VPS13</italic> fusion gene and location of primers used for ChIP. (Lower) RNAPII density at the promoter and through the coding region of <italic>GAL-VPS13</italic> was measured by ChIP, before (white bars) and upon (gray bars) gene activation and expression of the indicated TFIIS variants. The result is representative of two biological replicate experiments.</p>
        <p>(B) RNAPII density at the promoter (5′) and at the end of the coding region (3′) of the indicated genes was measured by ChIP, before and after expression of the indicated TFIIS variants. The 3′:5′ ratios of RNAPII density were calculated in the two conditions. For simplicity, the results are presented by setting the ratio in the vector control to one and then expressing the corresponding ratios in the others relative to that. Error bars represent standard deviation.</p>
