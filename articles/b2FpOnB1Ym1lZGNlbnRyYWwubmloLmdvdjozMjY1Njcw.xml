      <abstract>
        <p>In order to develop minimally toxic bone marrow transplantation (BMT) protocols suitable for use in a wider range of indications, it is important to identify ways to enhance BM engraftment at a given level of recipient conditioning. CXCL12/stromal cell-derived factor-1α plays a crucial physiological role in homing of hematopoietic stem cells to BM. It is regulated by the ectopeptidase dipeptidyl peptidase IV (DPPIV; DPP4) known as CD26, which cleaves dipeptides from the N-terminus of polypeptide chains. Blocking DPPIV enzymatic activity had a beneficial effect on hematopoietic stem cell engraftment in various but very specific experimental settings. Here we investigated whether inhibition of DPPIV enzymatic activity through Diprotin A or sitagliptin (Januvia) improves BM engraftment in nonmyeloablative murine models of syngeneic (i.e., CD45-congenic) and allogeneic (i.e., Balb/c to B6) BMT (1 Gy total body irradiation, 10–15 × 10<sup>6</sup> unseparated BM cells/mouse). Neither Diprotin A administered in vivo at the time of BMT and/or used for in vitro pretreatment of BM nor sitagliptin administered in vivo had a detectable effect on the level of multilineage chimerism (follow-up &gt;20 weeks). Similarly, sitagliptin did not enhance chimerism after allogeneic BMT, even though DPPIV enzymatic activity measured in serum was profoundly inhibited (&gt;98% inhibition at peak exposure). Our results provide evidence that DPPIV inhibition via Diprotin A or sitagliptin does not improve engraftment of unseparated BM in a nonmyeloablative BMT setting.</p>

  <body>
    <p>Allogeneic bone marrow transplantation (BMT) has therapeutic potential for a wide range of indications. Its clinical application remains limited mainly to the treatment of life-threatening diseases because of substantial toxicities associated with currently available BMT regimens.</p>
    <p>Transplantation of donor BM to induce mixed hematopoietic chimerism is an attractive experimental approach to induce robust and lasting donor-specific tolerance in organ transplantation <xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>. The clinical relevance of this tolerance strategy has recently been underscored by a pilot trial in which patients suffering from end-stage renal disease simultaneously received a kidney and BM graft from a human leukocyte antigen–mismatched living related donor <xref rid="bib2 bib3" ref-type="bibr">[2,3]</xref>. Most recipients in this small study became operationally tolerant. However, the nonmyeloablative conditioning regimen was associated with substantial side effects, such as profound leukopenia, rendering this regimen virtually unacceptable in the routine organ transplantation setting. Therefore, less toxic BMT regimens achieving sufficient engraftment with reduced myelosuppressive conditioning still need to be developed to allow a more widespread application of this strategy <xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>.</p>
    <p>In the experimental setting, less toxic mixed chimerism protocols have been generated gradually during the last several decades. The use of costimulatory blockers—some of which are already under clinical development as immunosuppressive drugs <xref rid="bib5 bib6" ref-type="bibr">[5,6]</xref>—as part of BMT protocols has allowed us to further reduce conditioning substantially <xref rid="bib7 bib8 bib9 bib10 bib11" ref-type="bibr">[7–11]</xref>. Short-course rapamycin <xref rid="bib12 bib13" ref-type="bibr">[12,13]</xref> and therapeutic administration of regulatory T cells <xref rid="bib1 bib14" ref-type="bibr">[1,14]</xref> have led to the most advanced murine minimum conditioning protocols. However, translation to nonhuman primate models has revealed that only transient chimerism is achieved with protocols that establish permanent chimerism in mice <xref rid="bib15 bib16" ref-type="bibr">[15,16]</xref>. Development of adjunctive treatments capable of promoting engraftment of a given dose of BM at a certain level of recipient myelosuppression is a critical goal toward clinical translation of the mixed chimerism approach.</p>
    <p>The chemoattractant stromal cell–derived factor-1 (CXCL12) binding to CXCR4 on hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) plays an important role in regulating trafficking of HSCs to BM <xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>. Dipeptidylpeptidase IV (DPPIV/CD26) is an ectopeptidase that cleaves stromal cell–derived factor-1 and thereby abrogates its chemotactic function <xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref> with the consequence of reduced homing of HSCs to their BM niches <xref rid="bib19 bib20" ref-type="bibr">[19,20]</xref>. Specific inhibition of DPPIV/CD26 via Diprotin A, an enzymatic inhibitor consisting of three amino acids (Ile-Pro-Ile), enhanced BM engraftment in certain murine BMT models <xref rid="bib21 bib22 bib23 bib24 bib25" ref-type="bibr">[21–25]</xref>. Notably, Christopherson et al. showed a benefit on engraftment when BM was incubated with Diprotin A before transplantation into myeloablated congenic recipients <xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>. Combining in vivo with in vitro treatment with Diprotin A was found to further enhance its efficacy <xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>. However, it remains undetermined whether DPPIV/CD26 inhibition promotes engraftment of unseparated BM in the nonmyeloablative mixed chimerism setting.</p>
    <p>An immunosuppressive role of DPPIV inhibition has also been suggested in organ transplantation models (not involving BMT), as an irreversible inhibitor of DPPIV abrogated acute rejection in rat lung and heart transplantation models <xref rid="bib26 bib27" ref-type="bibr">[26,27]</xref> and reduced ischemia/reperfusion injury <xref rid="bib28" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref>. This effect may be due to DPPIV/CD26-mediated truncation of mediators (such as cytokines and chemokines) <xref rid="bib29 bib30" ref-type="bibr">[29,30]</xref>, to a potential costimulatory function of CD26, or to so far unknown off-target effects of the inhibitor used <xref rid="bib31 bib32 bib33 bib34" ref-type="bibr">[31–34]</xref>.</p>
    <p>We report that neither in vitro DPPIV/CD26 enzymatic inhibition of donor BM using Diprotin A nor additional systemic inhibition led to enhanced BM engraftment in a congenic murine model using 1 Gy total body irradiation (TBI) and conventional doses of BM. Moreover, we provide evidence that the clinically approved DPPIV inhibitor sitagliptin <xref rid="bib35" ref-type="bibr">[35]</xref> completely blocked DPPIV/CD26 enzymatic activity in vivo, but nevertheless did not increase BM engraftment in either allogeneic or congenic models of nonmyeloablative BMT.</p>

In a 96-well plate, 5 μL serum samples were mixed with 0.5 mM Gly-Pro-4-Me-β-NA in 50 mM Tris buffer (pH 8.3) in a final volume of 110 μL. DPPIV activity was determined kinetically during 5 min at 37°C by measuring the velocities of 4-Me-β-NA release (λ<sub>ex</sub> = 340 nm, λ<sub>em</sub> = 430 nm) from the substrate using an Infinite 200 (Tecan Group Ltd., Switzerland) (all reagents were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich). Fluorescence intensity was related to a 4-Me-β-NA standard curve. The reversibility of the inhibitors in the serum samples and the dilution of these samples in the assay make it necessary to create a calibration curve with known concentrations of the inhibitors in murine serum to estimate the percentage in vivo inhibition of DPPIV enzymatic activity in the serum. Percentage inhibition was calculated by comparing DPPIV enzymatic activity of treated mice to control mice, which were not enzymatically inhibited (defined as 100% activity). In order to limit the number of blood draws per mouse, groups were split in two and blood was taken only once a day for each mouse (either at 2 hours or 12 hours post–DPPIV inhibitor administration).</p>

        <title>Inhibition of DPPIV with Diprotin A does not improve engraftment of unseparated congenic BM after nonmyeloablative conditioning</title>
        <p>To investigate the effect of DPPIV inhibition on the engraftment of unseparated BM in the absence of alloreactivity, we first used a CD45.2 → CD45.1 congenic donor-recipient combination <xref rid="bib36 bib41" ref-type="bibr">[36,41]</xref>. CD45.1 B6 mice conditioned with 1 Gy TBI received 15 × 10<sup>6</sup> unseparated CD45.2 BMCs that were or were not pretreated in vitro with the DPPIV inhibitor Diprotin A (n = 9/group) <xref rid="bib22" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>. Multilineage chimerism was followed in blood by flow cytometry. Lasting chimerism developed in all mice in both groups. During a period of 21 weeks post-BMT, chimerism levels were comparable between Diprotin A–pretreated (group B) and nontreated (group A) groups in all tested lineages at all analyzed time points (note: treated and nontreated groups were done in parallel within one experiment to allow optimal comparability) (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>A). At the end of follow-up, mean percentages (±standard deviation) of chimerism were 35.7% (±7.0%) vs 39.9% (±7.7%) among CD4 cells, 23.0% (±4.7%) vs 29.3% (±9.1%) among CD8 cells, 40.6% (±10.7%) vs 51.3% (±13.4%) among B cells, and 26.7% (±10.2%) vs 39.5% (±14.9%) among myeloid cells (Diprotin A pretreatment vs control group; <italic>p</italic> = NS for all lineages). Similarly, there were no differences in chimerism levels between groups in BM and spleen (<italic>p</italic> = NS, <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>B).</p>
        <p>Because a beneficial effect has been described when in vitro Diprotin A pretreatment of donor BM was combined with in vivo recipient treatment with Diprotin A <xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>, we tested whether such a combination regimen would impact engraftment in the nonmyeloablative congenic setting (group D). In addition to in vitro pretreatment of the BM, Diprotin A was injected in vivo together with the BM and every 12 hours thereafter for 3 days post-BMT (n = 5). Again, chimerism levels were similar with (group D) and without (group C) DPPIV inhibition at all tested time points (follow-up 22 weeks; <italic>p</italic> = NS for all time points) (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>A). At the end of follow-up, mean percentages of chimerism were 50.5% (±5.8%) vs 43.7% (±6.4%) among CD4 cells, 36.4% (±4.7%) vs 29.3% (±6.5%) among CD8 cells, 56.2% (±6.7%) vs 54.9% (±9.5%) among B cells, and 54.2% (±10.0%) vs 41.6% (±11.5%) among myeloid cells. Chimerism levels in BM and spleen were also comparable among groups.</p>
        <p>Collectively, these experiments demonstrate that DPPIV inhibition with Diprotin A does not lead to a detectable improvement of the engraftment of unseparated congenic BM in nonmyeloablatively conditioned recipients.</p>

        <title>Sitagliptin inhibits DPPIV enzymatic activity more effectively than Diprotin A</title>
        <p>To assess whether the failure to detect an engraftment effect is due to insufficient DPPIV inhibition achieved with in vivo Diprotin A treatment, serum DPPIV activity was measured.</p>
        <p>At peak exposure (2 hours after administration of Diprotin A, group D), DPPIV serum activity decreased to 78.1% and 55.1% in two (randomly selected) mice, whereas DPPIV activity remained essentially unchanged in one mouse (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>A). At the time of trough exposure (12 hours postadministration), enzymatic activity declined to 51.7%, 47.1%, and 16.1% in three remaining mice of the group (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>A). Thus, although Diprotin A inhibits DPPIV activity, inhibition is only moderate.</p>
        <p>Sitagliptin (Januvia) is a specific DPPIV inhibitor that has recently been approved for the treatment of type 2 diabetes <xref rid="bib42" ref-type="bibr">[42]</xref>. We hypothesized that a more complete (and clinically relevant) inhibition of DPPIV may be achieved with this drug. Sitagliptin has a half-life of about 12 to 14 hours <xref rid="bib43" ref-type="bibr">[43]</xref> and is administered once daily at a dose of 100 mg (i.e., roughly 1.3 mg/kg) in the clinical setting of type 2 diabetes. We measured DPPIV activity in serum of mice treated with 4 mg sitagliptin orally every 12 hours (160 mg/kg twice daily) (group E). Complete inhibition of DPPIV enzymatic activity at peak exposure (2 hours postadministration) was observed in all four tested mice (0.7%, 0.4%, 0.5%, and 0.5% enzymatic activity) (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>B). At trough level 12 hours after the last dose, enzymatic DPPIV activity decreased to a mean of 31.9% (i.e., 68% inhibition) (16.2%, 22.1%, 57.4% in the remaining three mice of the group) (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>B). Thus, in vivo treatment with sitagliptin leads to more effective inhibition of DPPIV activity at peak exposure than Diprotin A. However, with neither compound, a complete DPPIV inhibition for the entire treatment period was achieved, as moderate enzymatic activity at trough levels could still be observed.</p>

        <title>Despite superior DPPIV inhibition, sitagliptin does not improve engraftment of unseparated congenic BMT after nonmyeloablative conditioning</title>
        <p>To assess whether sitagliptin affects engraftment, we followed hematopoietic chimerism in sitagliptin-treated recipients of unseparated congenic BM (n = 7, group E). Again, no enhanced engraftment was detected on DPPIV inhibition (<italic>p</italic> = NS at all time points). Twenty-two weeks post-BMT mean chimerism levels were 48.8% (±5.7%) vs 43.7% (±6.4%) among CD4 cells, 34.5% (±3.0%) vs 29.3% (±6.5%) among CD8 cells, 60.1% (±9.8%) vs 54.9% (±9.5%) among B cells, and 48.6% (±11.1%) vs 41.6% (±11.5%) among myeloid cells (treated group E vs control group C) (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>A). Chimerism levels in BM and spleen (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>B) were also comparable (<italic>p</italic> = NS). Thus, with the more specific, clinically approved DPPIV inhibitor sitagliptin, no beneficial effect was detectable on the engraftment of congenic BM in nonmyeloablated recipient mice.</p>

        <title>Sitagliptin does not improve engraftment in a mixed chimerism model of allogeneic BMT with nonmyeloablative conditioning and costimulation blockade</title>
        <p>DPPIV inhibition was shown to affect alloreactivity in models of heart and lung transplantation <xref rid="bib26 bib27" ref-type="bibr">[26,27]</xref>. As little is known, however, about the effect of DPPIV inhibitors in allogeneic BMT, we tested whether sitagliptin may improve engraftment in an allogeneic mixed chimerism model of limiting conditioning. B6 mice conditioned with 1 Gy TBI (day –1), were transplanted with 15 × 10<sup>6</sup> fully mismatched Balb/c BMCs (day 0), and treated with anti-CD154 monoclonal antibody (day 0) and CTLA4Ig (day +2), as described previously <xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>. This BMT regimen is insufficient to induce reliable chimerism (and tolerance) by itself, but chimerism and tolerance can be achieved through adjunctive treatments, such as rapamycin <xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>. One group was treated with sitagliptin orally (group G, n = 6) and was compared to one left untreated (group F, n = 6).</p>
        <p>Again, sitagliptin nearly completely inhibited DPPIV enzymatic activity after 2 hours (0.9%, 1.0%, 1.0%, 1.8%) and activity remained substantially decreased in 2 of 4 mice (32.2%, 32.5%, 81.4%, &gt;85%) after 12 hours (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>C). As expected, without sitagliptin, mean chimerism levels were low with varying individual levels and several mice had no detectable T-cell chimerism at the end of follow-up (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref>A). Sitagliptin treatment, however, did not improve chimerism levels. Chimeric mice (six of seven chimeras in the sitagliptin-treated group vs five of six in the control group) showed chimerism levels of 1.6% (±1.1%) vs 1.8% (±2.5%) among CD4 cells, 0.4% (±0.6%) vs 3.5% (±3.1%) among CD8 cells, 7.5% (±3.8%) vs 8.8% (±4.1%) among B cells, and 16.6% (±12.5%) vs 21.8% (±10.3%) among myeloid cells for each lineage (<italic>p</italic> = NS). Similarly, chimerism levels and rates were also comparable between groups in spleen (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref>B).</p>
        <p>Donor and third-party skin was transplanted to assess donor-specific tolerance. Third-party grafts were promptly rejected in both groups. Donor skin graft survival was significantly prolonged in both groups but tolerance was not achieved, consistent with the poor T-cell chimerism (<italic>p</italic> = 0.5 sitagliptin-treated vs untreated recipients) <xref rid="bib8 bib44" ref-type="bibr">[8,44]</xref>.</p>
        <p>Taken together, these results indicate that sitagliptin does not improve engraftment of allogeneic BM under limiting recipient conditioning and consequently does not improve tolerance induction in this setting.</p>

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>Induction of donor-specific transplantation tolerance through mixed chimerism would be a potential new indication for allogeneic BMT. During the last 2 decades, the toxicity of the recipient conditioning was gradually reduced in murine chimerism models <xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>. Nevertheless cytotoxic conditioning used to achieve engraftment of clinically feasible numbers of BMCs keeps impeding clinical translation of such protocols. Minimally toxic BMT regimens would also be of interest to allow other potential indications of BMT <xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>.</p>
      <p>Inhibition or genetic ablation of DPPIV/CD26 showed promising engraftment-promoting effects in several murine models especially when limited numbers of donor cells were used <xref rid="bib25" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>. DPPIV enzymatic activity inhibition was effective in congenic (CD45-congenic) <xref rid="bib20 bib38" ref-type="bibr">[20,38]</xref>, xenogeneic (human cells into nonobese diabetic severe combined immune-deficient recipients) <xref rid="bib23 bib25" ref-type="bibr">[23,25]</xref>, and allogeneic (major histocompatibility complex–mismatched in utero transplantation) <xref rid="bib22" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref> systems. Engraftment-enhancing effects of DPPIV inhibition were not only observed with separated (Sca1<sup>+</sup>lin<sup>−</sup> murine BMCs or CD34<sup>+</sup> human mobilized peripheral blood/cord blood cells, respectively) <xref rid="bib20 bib24 bib25" ref-type="bibr">[20,24,25]</xref>, but also with unseparated populations <xref rid="bib20 bib22 bib38" ref-type="bibr">[20,22,38]</xref>. We therefore chose nonmyeloablative protocols using unseparated BMCs for evaluating DPPIV enzymatic inhibition, as such systems are commonly used in the clinical setting (but to the best of our knowledge have not been studied in the DPPIV inhibition context before). In addition, we targeted DPPIV in a fully allogeneic model, which would be similar to the clinical situation of tolerance induction in organ transplantation. In these settings, we did not detect a significant effect of DPPIV enzymatic activity inhibition on BM engraftment (despite using Diprotin A treatment schedules proven effective in other settings).</p>
      <p>In order to dissect whether a potential effect of DPPIV inhibition is due to modulating alloreactivity or HSC engraftment, we used two established models of nonmyeloablative BMT. The CD45.2 → CD45.1 congenic model is almost free of relevant immunological barriers <xref rid="bib36 bib41" ref-type="bibr">[36,41]</xref>. In the 1-Gy allogeneic protocol, immunosuppression—through rapamycin <xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref> or administration of T regulatory cells <xref rid="bib45" ref-type="bibr">[45]</xref>—leads to engraftment and lasting chimerism in this otherwise unsuccessful BMT protocol.</p>
      <p>Several DPPIV inhibitors have recently been approved for treatment of type 2 diabetes. We therefore tested whether sitagliptin enhances the engraftment of congenic or allogeneic BM after nonmyeloablative TBI. As compared to Diprotin A, sitagliptin is both a more potent and specific DPPIV inhibitor <xref rid="bib46" ref-type="bibr">[46]</xref> that would be of importance for translating experimental results to the clinical setting. Despite inhibition of DPPIV enzymatic serum activity, no beneficial effect of sitagliptin was detectable in our studies.</p>
      <p>Maximum inhibition of DPPIV serum activity (measured 2 hours after in vivo administration) was more profound with sitagliptin—achieving almost 100% inhibition—than with Diprotin A (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>). A rapid recovery of DPPIV systemic activity after Diprotin A treatment was also noted by Christopherson and colleagues <xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>, but this transient inhibition was nevertheless sufficient to positively affect engraftment in the myeloablative setting. Kim and colleagues reported prolongation of islet graft survival with sitagliptin <xref rid="bib47" ref-type="bibr">[47]</xref>. Sitagliptin was given in chow with a sitagliptin uptake of roughly 10 mg—48 mg per day resulting in 78% to 88% DPPIV inhibition. Notably, almost the full inhibitory effect was observed even with the lowest consumed dose of 10 mg (approximately 78% inhibition). In the clinical setting of type 2 diabetes, sitagliptin is administered once daily, as it has a half-life of about 12 to 14 hours <xref rid="bib43" ref-type="bibr">[43]</xref>. We therefore reasoned that oral administration every 12 hours (at a dose of 160 mg/kg twice daily compared to the clinical dose of approximately 1.3 mg/kg/day) would result in sufficient drug exposure during the critical period of HSC engraftment. It seems unlikely that the degree or duration of DPPIV inhibition is responsible for the lack of a detectable engraftment effect in our models.</p>
      <p>We think that several factors might be responsible for the lack of an effect of DPPIV inhibition in our present study. Models in which an engraftment-enhancing of DPPIV inhibition was found used either myeloablative conditioning or nonmyeloablative conditioning of immunodeficient recipients <xref rid="bib20 bib21 bib23 bib24 bib25 bib38" ref-type="bibr">[20,21,23–25,38]</xref>. To the best of our knowledge, our studies are the first to investigate the effect of DPPIV inhibition on BM engraftment in nonmyeloablatively conditioned wild-type recipients. In the environment of this different conditioning regimen, DPPIV inhibition might be unable to affect engraftment. Furthermore, an engraftment-enhancing effect of DPPIV inhibition on allogeneic HSC has been shown so far only after myeloablative conditioning or in utero transplantation <xref rid="bib21 bib22" ref-type="bibr">[21,22]</xref>. The potential effect on allogeneic BM engraftment after nonmyeloablative conditioning—which is of relevance for clinical BMT—has not been ascertained previously. Our results suggest that DPPIV inhibition is of limited therapeutic value in this setting. Besides, the current study is the first to investigate the use of costimulation blockade together with DPPIV inhibition. Although an interaction cannot be ruled out, such interference would be unable to explain the observed lack of an effect in the congenic system, in which no costimulation blockade was used.</p>
      <p>In summary, although DPPIV enzymatic inhibition had been demonstrated to have engraftment-promoting effects in several specific models of HSC transplantation, our studies provide evidence that DPPIV inhibition with Diprotin A or with sitagliptin does not lead to improved engraftment of unseparated BM after nonmyeloablative recipient conditioning.</p>
