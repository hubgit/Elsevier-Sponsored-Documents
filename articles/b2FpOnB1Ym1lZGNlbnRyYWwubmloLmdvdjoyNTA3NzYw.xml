        <title>Summary</title>
        <p>Replicative DNA damage bypass, mediated by the ubiquitylation of the sliding clamp protein PCNA, facilitates the survival of a cell in the presence of genotoxic agents, but it can also promote genomic instability by damage-induced mutagenesis. We show here that PCNA ubiquitylation in budding yeast is activated independently of the replication-dependent S phase checkpoint but by similar conditions involving the accumulation of single-stranded DNA at stalled replication intermediates. The ssDNA-binding replication protein A (RPA), an essential complex involved in most DNA transactions, is required for damage-induced PCNA ubiquitylation. We found that RPA directly interacts with the ubiquitin ligase responsible for the modification of PCNA, Rad18, both in yeast and in mammalian cells. Association of the ligase with chromatin is detected where RPA is most abundant, and purified RPA can recruit Rad18 to ssDNA in vitro. Our results therefore implicate the RPA complex in the activation of DNA damage tolerance.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>DNA damage tolerance enables a cell to resolve replication problems such as damage-induced fork stalling (<xref rid="bib15 bib18 bib35" ref-type="bibr">Lawrence, 1994; Lehmann, 2002; Ulrich, 2005</xref>). Replicative bypass of DNA lesions occurs via translesion synthesis (TLS) by specialized damage-tolerant DNA polymerases or by an error-free damage avoidance pathway that makes use of the information of the newly synthesized sister chromatid (<xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr">Lawrence, 1994</xref>). Both pathways are activated by posttranslational modification of the replicative sliding clamp, proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) (<xref rid="bib13 bib14 bib33 bib39" ref-type="bibr">Hoege et al., 2002; Kannouche et al., 2004; Stelter and Ulrich, 2003; Watanabe et al., 2004</xref>). In response to DNA damage, monoubiquitylation of PCNA at a conserved lysine, K164, activates the damage-tolerant polymerases for TLS, whereas polyubiquitylation is required for error-free damage avoidance. Independent of DNA damage, budding yeast PCNA is also modified during S phase by the ubiquitin-like protein SUMO (<xref rid="bib26 bib27" ref-type="bibr">Papouli et al., 2005; Pfander et al., 2005</xref>). PCNA monoubiquitylation involves the ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme (E2) Rad6 and its cognate ubiquitin ligase (E3), Rad18. A second E2-E3 pair, the heterodimeric E2 Ubc13-Mms2 with the E3 Rad5, is responsible for polyubiquitylation. Although it promotes resistance to genotoxic agents, TLS is a potentially mutagenic process that endangers the cell's genomic stability. At the same time, failure to reactivate stalled replication forks may lead to genome instability by inducing DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) and gross chromosomal aberrations (<xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">Branzei and Foiani, 2005</xref>). Stringent control over DNA damage bypass is therefore essential, but the upstream signals that activate PCNA modification in vivo are not well defined.</p>
      <p>One of the important regulatory mechanisms responsible for the sensing of DNA damage and replication stress is the replication-dependent S phase checkpoint, a surveillance system that inhibits the firing of late-replication origins, prevents cell-cycle progression to mitosis, and is important for the stabilization of stalled replication forks (<xref rid="bib3 bib25" ref-type="bibr">Branzei and Foiani, 2005; Nyberg et al., 2002</xref>). The ATR-ATRIP kinase complex and the PCNA-like 9-1-1 checkpoint clamp, responsible for initiating the checkpoint signaling cascade during S phase, are activated by replication fork stalling. Their recruitment to stretches of single-stranded (ss)DNA is mediated by interactions of ATRIP and the 9-1-1-specific clamp loader with the ssDNA-binding RPA complex (<xref rid="bib40 bib41" ref-type="bibr">Zou and Elledge, 2003; Zou et al., 2003</xref>).</p>
      <p>Our analysis of the mechanisms that control the activity of the <italic>RAD6</italic> pathway in budding yeast now reveals striking parallels to the replication checkpoint response: although the two systems operate independently, they are activated in a similar fashion by stalled replication intermediates that involve an accumulation of ssDNA. We show that yeast and human Rad18, like ATRIP and the 9-1-1 clamp loader, directly interact with the RPA complex. In vivo, the abundance of Rad18 on DNA mirrors that of RPA even in the absence of its physiological target, PCNA, and depletion of RPA prevents damage-induced PCNA ubiquitylation in S phase. In vitro, the RPA complex can recruit the ubiquitin ligase to ssDNA. These results suggest an effective activation mechanism for ubiquitin-dependent damage bypass.</p>

        <title>Replication Forks Are Required for PCNA Ubiquitylation</title>
        <p>In order to characterize the conditions required for PCNA ubiquitylation in <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic>, we examined possible contributions of the DNA damage checkpoint and cell-cycle regulation. We found that, in budding yeast, as in <italic>X. laevis</italic> egg extracts and in <italic>S. pombe</italic> (<xref rid="bib4 bib8" ref-type="bibr">Chang et al., 2006; Frampton et al., 2006</xref>), ubiquitin-dependent DNA damage tolerance and checkpoint signaling operate independently (see <xref rid="app2" ref-type="sec">Figure S1</xref> available online). Given the importance of ubiquitylated PCNA for replicative lesion bypass, the modification is expected to be most relevant during S phase. In fact, consistent with our previous findings (<xref rid="bib26" ref-type="bibr">Papouli et al., 2005</xref>) and with the situation in mammalian cells (<xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr">Kannouche et al., 2004</xref>), arrest in S phase with hydroxyurea (HU), which causes replication fork stalling by nucleotide depletion without directly damaging DNA, is sufficient to trigger PCNA modification (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>A). In contrast, ubiquitylated PCNA was not detected in G1- or G2-arrested cells even after treatment with DNA-damaging agents. This indicates that, even in asynchronous populations, all detectable PCNA ubiquitylation arises from S phase cells.</p>
        <p>The absence of ubiquitylated PCNA outside of S phase could be due to the lack of replication forks. Alternatively, the physiological state of the cell, defined by the activities of cyclin-dependent kinases, could control PCNA modification. In order to directly examine the need for DNA replication, we made use of a temperature-sensitive mutant of an essential kinase gene responsible for DNA replication initiation, <italic>cdc7<sup>ts</sup></italic> (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>) (<xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr">Hartwell, 1973</xref>). At the permissive temperature, <italic>cdc7<sup>ts</sup></italic> cells undergo regular cycles of DNA replication and cell division, whereas upon release from G1 arrest at the restrictive temperature, the mutant enters the cell cycle without initiating DNA replication (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>B). Degradation of the CDK inhibitor Sic1 at the beginning of S phase and later on the accumulation of the mitotic cyclin Clb2 proceeds normally in <italic>cdc7<sup>ts</sup></italic> cells (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>C), indicating that the physiological state under these conditions resembles a passage through the cell cycle. Following the scheme outlined in <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>A, we asked whether DNA damage would trigger PCNA modification in the mutant. We found that <italic>WT</italic> cells underwent PCNA ubiquitylation normally at 24°C and 37°C, but in <italic>cdc7<sup>ts</sup></italic> the modification was visible only at the permissive temperature (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>D). In order to exclude the possibility that the kinase activity of Cdc7 itself was needed for the modification, we examined a strain in which the requirement for <italic>CDC7</italic> is bypassed by a mutation in <italic>MCM5</italic>, encoding a subunit of the replicative helicase (<xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr">Hardy et al., 1997</xref>). In the context of this allele, <italic>bob1</italic>, deletion of <italic>CDC7</italic> did not abolish PCNA ubiquitylation, implying that the Cdc7 kinase itself is dispensable for modification of the clamp (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>E). This suggests that PCNA needs to be engaged in replication for efficient ubiquitylation in vivo.</p>

      <sec id="sec2.2">
        <title>Not All Types of DNA Damage Induce PCNA Ubiquitylation</title>
        <p>We next asked what types of lesions would induce PCNA modification during DNA replication. In addition to UV radiation and methyl methane sulfonate (MMS), which induce ubiquitylation in all species examined so far, agents that cause bulky adducts such as 4-nitroquinoline oxide (NQO) and also the oxidizing agent hydrogen peroxide (H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>) were found to be active (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>A). As observed in <italic>S. pombe</italic> (<xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">Frampton et al., 2006</xref>), PCNA was also ubiquitylated after treatment with ionizing radiation (IR) (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>A), despite our previous finding that PCNA ubiquitylation site mutants are not particularly sensitive to IR, and DSBs induced by an endonuclease do not cause PCNA modification (<xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">Chen et al., 2005</xref>). Moreover, mammalian cells do not ubiquitylate PCNA after IR treatment (<xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr">Kannouche et al., 2004</xref>). A possible explanation for the IR-induced modification of <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> and <italic>S. pombe</italic> PCNA may therefore be base damage associated with the high doses of radiation used in the yeast system rather than DSBs per se.</p>
        <p>To further explore this hypothesis, we analyzed the response to chemicals that cause DSBs by different mechanisms. Bleomycin, which acts independently of the cell-cycle phase, did not trigger PCNA modification (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>A), although it affected viability (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>B). Camptothecin (CPT), a topoisomerase I inhibitor, induces covalent adducts of the enzyme to DNA, which are converted to DSBs in S phase through collisions with replication forks (<xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr">Liu et al., 2000</xref>). Despite its S phase-specific action, CPT treatment did not result in PCNA ubiquitylation (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>A). In order to exclude the possibility that the drug had simply no effect at the concentrations used in this experiment, we examined PCNA modifications in a <italic>rad52</italic> mutant, which is highly sensitive to CPT (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>C). Again, we did not observe PCNA ubiquitylation in response to CPT in <italic>rad52</italic>, whereas its reaction to MMS was comparable to that of <italic>WT</italic> cells (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>D). Likewise, CPT induces PCNA modifications very modestly in <italic>S. pombe</italic> when compared to HU or UV (<xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">Frampton et al., 2006</xref>), and the drug is also a poor inducer of the replication checkpoint in budding yeast (<xref rid="bib28" ref-type="bibr">Redon et al., 2003</xref>) (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>E).</p>
        <p>Replication fork stalling by treatment with HU or adduct-forming agents like MMS results in an inhibition of DNA polymerases and an accumulation of ssDNA due to the continuing movement of the replicative helicase (<xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">Branzei and Foiani, 2005</xref>). In contrast, collision of the replication machinery with CPT-induced topoisomerase adducts and DSB formation is expected to affect the entire replicon and should therefore not initially involve an accumulation of ssDNA. In support of this model, radioactive labeling of nondenatured total DNA by random priming was significantly enhanced after MMS or HU, but not after CPT treatment (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>F). This even applied to the checkpoint-defective <italic>rad53</italic> mutant, which is known to accumulate ssDNA in response to replication stress (<xref rid="bib32" ref-type="bibr">Sogo et al., 2002</xref>). In <italic>rad52</italic> cells, the difference was less pronounced, but we cannot rule out a replication-independent effect of the mutation—for example, on formation or resection of DSBs—that would have no consequences for PCNA modification. Thus, PCNA ubiquitylation correlates well with elevated levels of ssDNA during replication.</p>

        <title>Overexpression of RAD18 Relaxes the Conditions for PCNA Modification</title>
        <p>Given that the ubiquitin ligases, Rad18 and Rad5, are ssDNA-binding proteins, they might directly recognize a blocked fork by associating with the stretches of ssDNA adjacent to the stalled polymerase-PCNA complex. If these enzymes are limiting factors in transmitting the signal for modification, changes in their abundance should affect the extent of modification. We therefore analyzed the consequences of overexpressing <italic>RAD18</italic>, encoding the E3 responsible for PCNA monoubiquitylation. <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>B shows that overexpression of <italic>RAD18</italic> caused significantly increased levels of ubiquitylated PCNA. In asynchronous populations, <italic>RAD18</italic> overexpression resulted in constitutive modification of PCNA even in undamaged cells, suggesting that fork stalling was no longer required. Likewise, the modification was no longer restricted to S phase, as ubiquitylated PCNA now appeared in G1- and G2-arrested cells. Outside of S phase, however, DNA damage was still a prerequisite for the reaction. Taken together, elevated levels of Rad18 afforded PCNA ubiquitylation whenever the clamp was detectable in association with chromatin (<xref rid="app2" ref-type="sec">Figure S2</xref>), strongly suggesting that the modification takes place on DNA. Consistent with this notion, loading of PCNA onto DNA was shown to be required for efficient modification in vitro (<xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">Garg and Burgers, 2005</xref>).</p>
      </sec>
      <sec id="sec2.4">
        <title>RPA Is Required for Ubiquitylation of PCNA</title>
        <p>Our findings suggest that PCNA ubiquitylation is induced by the recruitment of Rad18 to regions of ssDNA exposed by the uncoupling of helicase movement from DNA synthesis, analogous to the way in which stalled forks are believed to activate the replication checkpoint (<xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">Branzei and Foiani, 2005</xref>). Considering that the factor responsible for recruitment of the ATR kinase complex and the 9-1-1 clamp loader is not naked ssDNA but rather ssDNA coated by the ssDNA-binding RPA complex (<xref rid="bib40 bib41" ref-type="bibr">Zou and Elledge, 2003; Zou et al., 2003</xref>), we examined a possible contribution of RPA to PCNA ubiquitylation.</p>
        <p>The <italic>rfa1-t11</italic> mutant (K45E), defective in homologous recombination and recruitment of checkpoint factors (<xref rid="bib37 bib40 bib41" ref-type="bibr">Umezu et al., 1998; Zou and Elledge, 2003; Zou et al., 2003</xref>), was competent in damage-induced PCNA ubiquitylation (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>A). Likewise, a temperature-sensitive mutant, <italic>rfa1-t33</italic> (S373P), which is unable to mediate DNA replication at the restrictive temperature (<xref rid="bib37" ref-type="bibr">Umezu et al., 1998</xref>), ubiquitylated PCNA normally. This indicates that the replicative function of RPA is not required for PCNA modification. However, even at the restrictive temperature, the mutant protein was found in association with DNA (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>B), which leaves the possibility that it was still able to promote the recruitment or activation of Rad18. A panel of <italic>rfa2</italic> and <italic>rfa3</italic> mutants defective in various aspects of DNA replication and repair (<xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr">Maniar et al., 1997</xref>) had relatively minor effects on PCNA ubiquitylation (<xref rid="app2" ref-type="sec">Figure S3</xref>). We therefore examined the consequences of depleting Rfa1 by means of a heat-inducible degradation signal (<xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">Dohmen et al., 1994</xref>). Following the procedure outlined in <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>C, we induced degradation of the Rfa1<sup>td</sup> protein in G1-arrested cells. The <italic>rfa1-td</italic> mutant engaged in DNA replication (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>D) with less than 5% of the Rfa1<sup>td</sup> protein remaining, but damage-induced PCNA ubiquitylation was almost completely abolished (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>E). In contrast, S phase-associated sumoylation of PCNA, which likewise depends on DNA replication (our unpublished results), was not impaired (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>E), implying that the lack of ubiquitylation is not due to a general failure to modify PCNA. In addition, comparable amounts of PCNA were chromatin-associated in <italic>WT</italic> and <italic>rfa1-td</italic> (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>F), suggesting that replication forks remain largely intact when Rfa1 levels are seriously reduced. These findings indicate that RPA is required for damage-dependent ubiquitylation of PCNA during S phase, independent of its function in DNA replication, recombination, and the recruitment of checkpoint factors.</p>

        <title>Rad18 Interacts with the RPA Complex</title>
        <p>We asked whether RPA contributes directly to the recruitment of the ubiquitylation machinery to stalled replication intermediates by examining possible interactions between Rad18, Rad5, and the RPA subunits. In the two-hybrid system, we observed an interaction of Rad18, but not of Rad5, with the subunits Rfa1 and Rfa2 in addition to mutual interactions among the three RPA subunits (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref>A). In order to exclude indirect effects, we examined the interaction of recombinant yeast Rad6-Rad18 complex (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref>B) with RPA immobilized on Sepharose beads. Purified <sup>HisVSV</sup>Rad18 was retained on the beads in the presence of a nuclease, indicating that the interaction was direct and not mediated by DNA or other cellular factors (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref>C).</p>
        <p>Analysis of truncations and mutations of Rad18 in the two-hybrid system revealed that an N-terminal portion of Rad18, including the RING domain, is sufficient for interaction, whereas the central Zinc finger and a DNA-binding SAP domain (<xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr">Notenboom et al., 2007</xref>) are irrelevant (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref>D). Within Rfa1, we mapped the interaction site to the central region spanning amino acids 167–452 (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref>E), which comprises the primary ssDNA-binding motifs of RPA. This interaction, as well as the association between Rad18 and Rfa2, was confirmed in vitro using recombinant constructs <sup>GST</sup>Rfa1(182–421), <sup>GST</sup>Rfa2, and <sup>HisVSV</sup>Rad18 (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref>F). Thus, both subunits, Rfa1 and Rfa2, contribute independently to the interaction with the E3.</p>
        <p>Coimmunoprecipitations from strains bearing epitope-tagged <italic>RAD18<sup>6HA</sup></italic> and <italic>RFA1<sup>9myc</sup></italic> in their native contexts confirmed the association of Rad18 with RPA in vivo (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref>G). The interaction did not vary measurably between damaged and undamaged cells (data not shown). Considering the conservation of PCNA modification in eukaryotes, we asked whether interaction of Rad18 with RPA was detectable in human cells. Upon transfection with an expression construct for FLAG-tagged human Rad18, isolation of <sup>FLAG</sup>hRad18 indeed resulted in copurification of endogenous hRPA both from the cytoplasmic and the chromatin-associated fraction (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref>H). Addition of nuclease did not abolish the interactions in yeast or mammalian extracts (data not shown), indicating that they are primarily mediated by protein-protein contacts. These observations raised the question of whether Rad18 is recruited to ssDNA by means of its interaction with RPA.</p>

        <title>Association of Rad18 with ssDNA Correlates with that of RPA Even in the Absence of PCNA</title>
        <p>Chromatin immunoprecipitations (ChIPs) from yeast cells bearing a <italic>RAD18<sup>9myc</sup></italic> allele provided evidence for association of Rad18 with chromatin in vivo. In HU-treated cells, Rad18<sup>9myc</sup>, like RPA and PCNA (<xref rid="bib26" ref-type="bibr">Papouli et al., 2005</xref>), was detectable at replication forks in the vicinity of a replication origin (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6</xref>A). In order to exclude the possibility that the presence of Rad18 at this site was merely due to its interaction with PCNA, we analyzed the chromatin association of Rad18 at stretches of ssDNA that result from the resection of a DSB induced by the HO endonuclease (<xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr">Lee et al., 1998</xref>). In this context, RPA initially associates with sequences adjacent to the break but is displaced by the recombinogenic Rad51 filament in a Rad52-dependent manner (<xref rid="bib38" ref-type="bibr">Wang and Haber, 2004</xref>) (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6</xref>B). Although PCNA is easily detectable at replication forks by ChIP (<xref rid="bib26" ref-type="bibr">Papouli et al., 2005</xref>), the protein was absent from the DSB (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6</xref>C). We had previously failed to observe significant Rad18<sup>9myc</sup> association by ChIP using multiplex PCR (<xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">Chen et al., 2005</xref>); however, with a more sensitive real-time PCR method, we were able to detect a 2-fold enrichment after induction of the HO endonuclease (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6</xref>D). This small but reproducible signal is likely to be significant, as it was abolished in an <italic>mre11</italic> mutant, in which ssDNA forms more slowly (<xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr">Lee et al., 1998</xref>) (<xref rid="app2" ref-type="sec">Figure S4</xref>). Importantly, inhibition of Rad51 filament formation by deletion of <italic>RAD52</italic> resulted in strongly enhanced association of Rad18<sup>9myc</sup> (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6</xref>D), consistent with elevated RPA levels on the ssDNA in this mutant (<xref rid="bib38" ref-type="bibr">Wang and Haber, 2004</xref>) (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6</xref>B). Thus, the amount of Rad18 on ssDNA correlates with that of RPA even where PCNA is not present.</p>

        <title>RPA Can Recruit Rad18 to ssDNA In Vitro</title>
        <p>To gain insight into how RPA might associate with Rad18 on ssDNA, we examined the effect of RPA on the DNA binding of <sup>HisVSV</sup>Rad18 to an immobilized 75 nt oligonucleotide in vitro. At 250 mM sodium chloride, binding of <sup>HisVSV</sup>Rad18 by itself was undetectable, but increasing levels of RPA afforded a robust and RPA-specific enrichment of the E3 in the bound material, indicating that RPA recruits <sup>HisVSV</sup>Rad18 to ssDNA (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7</xref>A). Similar results were obtained at 150 mM NaCl (data not shown). Surprisingly, under low-salt conditions, <sup>HisVSV</sup>Rad18 alone associated with the oligonucleotide, and RPA now caused a reduction in the amount of bound <sup>HisVSV</sup>Rad18 (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7</xref>B). However, comparable quantities of the bacterial ssDNA-binding protein, SSB, competed much more effectively with <sup>HisVSV</sup>Rad18 than RPA, indicating that, even at low ionic strength, RPA and the E3 can occupy a common stretch of DNA.</p>
        <p>In order to assess in a simplified system whether RPA can simultaneously interact with ssDNA and Rad18, we examined the interaction of the E3 with <sup>GST</sup>Rfa1(182–421) in the presence of short oligonucleotides with no measurable affinity for Rad18 (data not shown) and varying affinities for Rfa1 (<xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">Fanning et al., 2006</xref>) (<xref rid="app2" ref-type="sec">Figure S5</xref>). We found that ssDNA prebound to Rfa1 enhanced retention of Rad18, suggesting that Rfa1 in its DNA-bound conformation interacts with Rad18 better than free in solution (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7</xref>C). An interaction of RPA with Rad18 not involving DNA binding of Rad18 itself thus appears possible. Yet, the Rad18 SAP domain, responsible for DNA binding of the human protein (<xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr">Notenboom et al., 2007</xref>), was previously shown to be involved in the assembly of the E3 at replication foci (<xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr">Nakajima et al., 2006</xref>). Inactivation of this domain in yeast Rad18 abolished its function in vivo, as judged by PCNA modification and DNA damage sensitivity (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figures 7</xref>C and 7D), despite the ability of the mutants to autoubiquitylate in vitro (data not shown). Hence, DNA binding by Rad18 itself also appears to be important for its activity toward PCNA.</p>

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>RPA has been implicated in virtually all eukaryotic DNA transactions (<xref rid="bib7 bib42" ref-type="bibr">Fanning et al., 2006; Zou et al., 2006</xref>). Its stabilizing effect on ssDNA is essential for replication, recombination, and nucleotide excision repair, but the complex engages in DNA metabolism even more directly by means of protein-protein interactions, for example with DNA polymerase α/primase or the recombination protein Rad52. During S phase, RPA-coated ssDNA signals replication stress by recruiting the PCNA-like 9-1-1 clamp and the ATR/ATRIP checkpoint kinase complex to sites where polymerase stalling has resulted in exposure of extended stretches of ssDNA (<xref rid="bib40 bib41" ref-type="bibr">Zou and Elledge, 2003; Zou et al., 2003</xref>). Our findings now point to an even more general role of RPA in dealing with replication problems that appears to be conserved from yeast to mammals.</p>
      <sec id="sec3.1">
        <title>RPA Contributes Independently to Damage Signaling and Damage Bypass</title>
        <p>Loss of PCNA ubiquitylation upon depletion of Rfa1 implicates RPA in the activation of the <italic>RAD6</italic> pathway, suggesting that the complex is responsible not only for the sensing of damaged DNA and the stabilization of stalled forks but also for initiating the steps necessary to overcome the damage that caused the arrest. Our results indicate that the requirements of RPA for replication and recombination are genetically and physically separable from its role in DNA damage bypass.</p>
        <p>Identification of RPA-covered ssDNA as an upstream signal for the <italic>RAD6</italic> pathway explains a large body of circumstantial evidence defining the conditions that induce PCNA ubiquitylation. Although experiments with synchronized cells suggest that DNA damage causes PCNA ubiquitylation primarily during S phase, the cell-cycle stage itself is irrelevant for the modification: on one hand, a replication initiation defect abolishes PCNA ubiquitylation under conditions that physiologically resemble S phase. On the other hand, the reaction can be triggered in G1 by stalled replication intermediates resulting from the processing of DNA interstrand crosslinks (<xref rid="bib29" ref-type="bibr">Sarkar et al., 2006</xref>). Hence, stalled replication intermediates appear to be both necessary and sufficient for activation of PCNA ubiquitylation.</p>
        <p>A need for ssDNA at the sites of stalled replication intermediates is implied by our inability to detect PCNA modification in response to DSB-inducing agents that do not cause base damage. Even CPT, which induces strand breaks in a replication-dependent manner and stalls replication forks, did not result in PCNA ubiquitylation, consistent with our finding that this drug does not cause accumulation of ssDNA. By similar reasoning, uncoupling between polymerase and helicase has been suggested to activate damage bypass in <italic>X. laevis</italic> egg extracts (<xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">Chang et al., 2006</xref>).</p>
        <p>Elevated levels of Rad18 can overcome the requirement for fork stalling and promote ubiquitylation of PCNA whenever the clamp is associated with DNA (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>B). This suggests that the E3 is rate limiting for the reaction, and higher concentrations will drive ubiquitylation at shorter or more transient stretches of ssDNA during undisturbed replication. Constitutive modification of PCNA, as observed in <italic>S. pombe</italic> and in <italic>X. laevis</italic> egg extracts (<xref rid="bib8 bib16" ref-type="bibr">Frampton et al., 2006; Leach and Michael, 2005</xref>), might therefore be caused by a higher expression level or a lower activation threshold of Rad18 in these systems. A higher incidence of spontaneous fork stalling or intrinsic damage might have the same effect.</p>
        <p>Finally, a placement of RPA-covered ssDNA upstream of PCNA ubiquitylation explains the similarities between the signals for modification of the clamp and those that elicit the replication-dependent S phase checkpoint (<xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">Branzei and Foiani, 2005</xref>). Given that the domains required for the recruitment of the checkpoint factors and for interaction with Rad18 are distinct, the two pathways—damage sensing and damage bypass—appear to originate independently from a common structure. Intriguingly, a reduction in PCNA ubiquitylation has been reported in mammalian cells upon siRNA-mediated downregulation of ATR (<xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr">Bi et al., 2006</xref>). Hence, while damage tolerance is clearly independent of checkpoint function in <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> (<xref rid="app2" ref-type="sec">Figure S1</xref>), <italic>S. pombe</italic>, and <italic>X. laevis</italic> (<xref rid="bib4 bib8" ref-type="bibr">Chang et al., 2006; Frampton et al., 2006</xref>), an indirect contribution of the kinase in the mammalian system remains possible.</p>

        <title>Interactions of RPA and Rad18 on ssDNA</title>
        <p>RPA is well known for a complicated DNA-binding behavior that involves several distinct binding modes and varies considerably with ionic strength (<xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">Fanning et al., 2006</xref>). Interactions with other cellular factors may involve either one or multiple of its subunits, and these interactions often induce conformational changes of RPA. Recruitment of other proteins by RPA can involve cooperative binding but also a “trading of places” whereby a replication or repair factor would replace the RPA domains in a stepwise manner (<xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">Fanning et al., 2006</xref>). Our in vitro experiments reveal that both protein-protein and protein-DNA interactions are likely to contribute to the recruitment of Rad18 to ssDNA. In particular, we found that the affinity of Rad18 for ssDNA and RPA strongly depends on ionic strength. While modulation of the reaction buffer imposes rather artificial conditions on the RPA-Rad18-ssDNA interaction, our experiments have nevertheless revealed two patterns that might explain in principle how the two proteins can interact on DNA: at low ionic strength, Rad18 exhibits detectable affinity for ssDNA by itself but does not engage in cooperative interactions with RPA. In physiological salt conditions, however, RPA is clearly necessary for recruitment of Rad18 to ssDNA, and interaction of Rad18 with the DNA-binding domain of Rfa1 is enhanced when the latter is bound to ssDNA (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7</xref>). Whether the association in vivo relies solely on protein-protein interactions or whether RPA and Rad18 bind cooperatively to the DNA needs to be determined. A change between the two interaction modes during recruitment of Rad18 would explain the requirement of both RPA and the Rad18 SAP domain for PCNA ubiquitylation. However, the SAP domain may also have other functions in addition to DNA binding.</p>

        <title>Implications of the Rad18-RPA Interaction for Rad18 Function</title>
        <p>The physical interactions between RPA and Rad18, detectable in yeast and mammalian cells, suggest that RPA recruits Rad18 to ssDNA by direct association. In the context of a stalled replication fork, it is likely that additional cellular factors will also influence the behavior of Rad18. For example, interaction of the E3 with its target, PCNA, might affect its DNA-binding properties. Alternatively, Rad18 might undergo a conformational change upon DNA binding that would in turn modulate its interactions with PCNA, RPA, or Rad5. Notably, C-terminal truncations of Rad18 excluding the DNA-binding SAP domain consistently exhibit stronger interaction signals than the full-length protein in two-hybrid assays (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref>D) (<xref rid="bib36" ref-type="bibr">Ulrich and Jentsch, 2000</xref>), possibly indicating an inhibitory function of the C-terminal domain that might be relieved by DNA binding. Further biochemical studies and isolation of selectively interaction-deficient mutants of both Rad18 and RPA will be necessary to define the molecular mechanism by which RPA targets Rad18 to its sites of action. However, the presence of Rad18 at ssDNA in vivo correlates with that of RPA even in the absence of its ubiquitylation target, PCNA. Association of the E3 with HO-induced DSBs might therefore suggest additional, PCNA-independent functions. Consistent with this notion, yeast <italic>rad18</italic>, but not ubiquitylation-deficient PCNA mutants, are highly sensitive to IR (<xref rid="bib5 bib9" ref-type="bibr">Chen et al., 2005; Friedl et al., 2001</xref>), and the phenotypes of vertebrate <italic>rad18<sup>−/−</sup></italic> cells have implicated the E3 in the repair of DNA-strand breaks and recombination (<xref rid="bib30 bib34" ref-type="bibr">Shiomi et al., 2007; Szuts et al., 2006</xref>). However, the relevant ubiquitylation targets as well as possible contributions of the RPA complex to these alternative functions remain to be identified.</p>

        <p>Binding of <sup>HisVSV</sup>Rad18 to RPA-covered ssDNA was examined by immobilizing a 75 nt, 5′-biotinylated oligonucleotide of mixed sequence on streptavidin agarose (Pierce) in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) with 1 mM EDTA for 1 hr at RT. After washing three times in PBS with 1 mM EDTA and three times in binding buffer (25 mM HEPES-NaOH [pH 7.5], 15 mM KCl, 1 mM EDTA, 0.05% Triton X-100, 0.5 mM DTT, 100 μg/ml BSA, supplemented with 150 or 250 mM NaCl for high-salt conditions), 15 μl beads per reaction (∼5 pmol of the oligonucleotide) were incubated with increasing amounts of purified yeast RPA or bacterial SSB (2.4, 8, and 24 pmol) for 30 min at 4°C. Beads were washed once, and ∼5 pmol <sup>HisVSV</sup>Rad18 was added. Incubation was continued for 1 hr at 4°C, and the beads were washed three times with high-salt binding buffer and twice with the same buffer containing no BSA. Bound material was eluted as above and detected by western blotting. For RPA blots, equal fractions of input and bound material were loaded. For Rad18 blots, 1% of the input and 35% of the bound material were loaded.</p>

        <p>(A) Cell-cycle dependence of PCNA modification. Cells arrested in G1, S, and G2 phase were treated with 0.02% MMS for 90 min where indicated, and modifications of <sup>His</sup>PCNA, isolated under denaturing conditions, were detected by western blot. DNA contents were monitored by flow cytometry (FACS). Asynchronous cells (AS) were processed in parallel.</p>
        <p>(B) Effects of <italic>RAD18</italic> overexpression on PCNA modification throughout the cell cycle. Cells were treated and analyzed as in (A). Note that, in this panel, monoubiquitylated PCNA is abundant enough to be detected by the anti-ubiquitin antibody, which recognizes this form very poorly (<xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr">Hoege et al., 2002</xref>). Rad18 was detected in total cell extracts.</p>

        <p>RPA Is Required for PCNA Ubiquitylation</p>
        <p>(A) PCNA is ubiquitylated normally in the <italic>rfa1-t11</italic> and <italic>rfa1-t33</italic> mutants. MMS-induced PCNA ubiquitylation was detected as described in the legend to <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref> in <italic>WT</italic> (<italic>RFA1</italic>) and two <italic>rfa1</italic> mutants.</p>
        <p>(B) DNA association of the mutant protein encoded by <italic>rfa1-t33</italic> is indistinguishable from the <italic>WT</italic> protein at 25°C and 37°C. Whole-cell extracts (W) were fractionated by centrifugation into soluble (S) and chromatin-associated (C) material. Proteins were detected by western blot. The distributions of the chromatin-associated Orc6 protein and soluble PGK served as controls for the quality of fractionation.</p>
        <p>(C) Experimental strategy to deplete Rfa1<sup>td</sup> from yeast cells. In the <italic>rfa1-td</italic> strain, the construct encoding the heat-labile Rfa1<sup>td</sup> protein is controlled by a doxycycline (Dox)-repressible promoter, and <italic>UBR1</italic>, encoding the E3 responsible for degradation of Rfa1<sup>td</sup>, is induced by galactose (Gal). Rfa1<sup>td</sup> remains stable at 25°C in raffinose (Raf) medium. Temperature effects were excluded by returning the cells to 25°C without allowing resynthesis of Rfa1<sup>td</sup> before releasing them into S phase.</p>
        <p>(D) DNA replication proceeds after depletion of the Rfa1<sup>td</sup> protein. FACS samples were taken before and 50 min after release from G1 arrest following the scheme shown in (C).</p>
        <p>(E) Loss of damage-induced PCNA ubiquitylation after depletion of the Rfa1<sup>td</sup> protein. <sup>His</sup>PCNA and its modified forms were detected as in <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>. Rfa1 was detected in total cell extracts.</p>
        <p>(F) Chromatin association of PCNA in <italic>RFA1</italic> and <italic>rfa1-td</italic>. Chromatin-binding assays were performed as described in (B). Note that the Rfa1<sup>td</sup> protein remaining after depletion is entirely associated with chromatin. The degron tag is partially cleaved from the protein during extract preparation.</p>

        <p>Interaction of Rad18 with the RPA Complex</p>
        <p>(A) Protein-protein interactions between Rad18, Rad5, and the RPA subunits Rfa1, Rfa2, and Rfa3 in the yeast two-hybrid system. The open reading frames were expressed as fusions to the Gal4 activation (AD) and DNA-binding domains (BD), and the presence of the constructs was confirmed by growth on selective medium (-LW). Positive interactions were scored by growth on plates lacking histidine (-HLW) and stronger interactions on plates lacking histidine and adenine (-AHLW). Interactions between Rad18 and Rad5 (<xref rid="bib36" ref-type="bibr">Ulrich and Jentsch, 2000</xref>) and between the individual RPA subunits are shown as internal controls.</p>

        <p>(C) Interaction between purified recombinant RPA, covalently coupled to Sepharose, and <sup>HisVSV</sup>Rad18. <sup>HisVSV</sup>Rad18 retained on the RPA beads was eluted in Laemmli buffer and detected by western blotting. BSA-coupled beads served as negative control.</p>
        <p>(D) Two-hybrid analysis of the Rad18 domains interacting with Rfa1 and Rfa2. The scheme on the right indicates the RING domain, a Zinc finger (ZF), a SAP domain, and the region relevant for interaction with Rad6. Positions C48 and C190 are indicated by asterisks in the respective mutants.</p>
        <p>(E) Two-hybrid analysis of the Rfa1 domains interacting with Rad18. The scheme on the right indicates the regions relevant for ssDNA binding and holocomplex formation as well as a Zinc finger domain. The position of the <italic>rfa1-t11</italic> mutation (<xref rid="bib37" ref-type="bibr">Umezu et al., 1998</xref>) is indicated by an asterisk.</p>
        <p>(F) Interaction of Rad18 with the ssDNA-binding domain of Rfa1 and with Rfa2 in vitro. Purified recombinant <sup>GST</sup>Rfa1(182–421) or Rfa2, immobilized on glutathione Sepharose, was incubated with <sup>HisVSV</sup>Rad18. Bound material was eluted and analyzed by western blot to detect Rad18 (upper panel) or by Coomassie staining to detect the GST constructs (lower panel).</p>
        <p>(G) In vivo interaction of Rad18 with RPA was analyzed by coimmunoprecipitation of yeast Rad18<sup>6HA</sup> and Rfa1<sup>9myc</sup> by using the indicated antibodies. Strains expressing untagged <italic>RAD18</italic> or <italic>RFA1</italic> served as negative controls for precipitation of Rad18<sup>6HA</sup> and Rfa1<sup>9myc</sup>, respectively. In the anti-Rfa1 precipitation, antibody was omitted as a negative control. Bands of higher molecular weight in anti-HA precipitates represent ubiquitylated Rad18<sup>6HA</sup>.</p>
        <p>(H) Interaction between hRad18 and hRPA in cultured human cells. Immunoprecipitations (anti-FLAG) were performed from extracts derived from HEK293T cells transiently transfected with an expression construct for <sup>FLAG</sup>hRad18. Cells transfected with the empty vector served as negative control. Extracts were partitioned into detergent-soluble (S) and -insoluble (I) material. Note that <sup>FLAG</sup>hRad18 is monoubiquitylated in the soluble fraction, which includes the cytoplasmic material, but not in the chromatin-associated fraction.</p>
