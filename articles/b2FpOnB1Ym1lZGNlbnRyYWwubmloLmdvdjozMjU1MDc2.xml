          <title>Results</title>
          <p>Cells were stepped from −60 to 40 mV to evoke voltage dependent currents using a modified K<sup>+</sup> pipette solution containing ethylene glycol tetraacetic acid (5 mM) and adenosine triphosphate (3 mM) to eliminate large conductance Ca activated K channel and K<sub>adenosine triphosphate</sub> currents. Application of the KCNQ blockers XE991, linopirdine (Tocris Bioscience, Ellisville, Missouri) and chromanol 293B (Sigma®) decreased the outward current in concentration dependent fashion. The current-voltage relationship of XE991 sensitive current revealed a voltage dependent, outwardly rectifying current that activated positive to −60 mV and showed little inactivation. The KCNQ openers flupirtine and meclofenamic acid (Sigma) increased outward currents across the voltage range. In current clamp mode XE991 or chromanol 293B decreased interstitial cell of Cajal resting membrane potential and elicited the firing of spontaneous transient depolarizations in otherwise quiescent cells. Flupirtine or meclofenamic acid hyperpolarized interstitial cells of Cajal and inhibited any spontaneous electrical activity.</p>

    <p>T<sc>he</sc> discovery of ICC in the bladder has provided the opportunity to investigate a novel potential control mechanism of bladder smooth muscle activity. Several subtypes of ICC are present in the bladder wall, including ICC-LP, intramuscular ICC on the boundary of detrusor smooth muscle bundles and interbundle ICC between smooth muscle bundles. There are reported differences in the morphological and physiological properties of ICC-LP and the detrusor ICC subpopulations. For example, ICC-LP form a network of stellate-shaped cells connected by gap junctions that respond to purinergic agonists but do not respond to cholinergic stimulation.<xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr"><sup>1</sup></xref> However, detrusor ICC are spindle-shaped cells with lateral branches that do not form networks, but rather respond to cholinergic agonists by firing Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients.<xref rid="bib2 bib3" ref-type="bibr"><sup>2,3</sup></xref> ICC-LP have been proposed to participate in sensory processing, whereas intramuscular ICC have been suggested to modulate the activity of neighboring smooth muscle.</p>
    <p>K<sup>+</sup> channels have an important ubiquitous role in regulating resting membrane potential and, therefore, the excitability of many cell types. Guinea pig detrusor ICC have several types of K<sup>+</sup> channels, including BK and voltage dependent delayed rectifiers.<xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr"><sup>4</sup></xref> A component of total K<sup>+</sup> current in detrusor ICC was not identified by McCloskey,<xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr"><sup>4</sup></xref> which may be attributable to less well-known voltage dependent K<sup>+</sup> channels such as KCNQ (Kv7). There is reason to believe that KCNQ currents might be present in bladder cells because Streng et al noted decreased capsaicin induced bladder overactivity or hypercontractility when the KCNQ channel opener retigabine was delivered intravesically in conscious rats.<xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr"><sup>5</sup></xref></p>
    <p>KCNQs are voltage dependent K<sup>+</sup> channels that have been widely studied in the nervous system, heart and inner ear.<xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr"><sup>6</sup></xref> Mutations in these channels lead to cardiac arrhythmias, such as long QT syndrome and sudden death,<xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr"><sup>7</sup></xref> benign familial neonatal convulsions or epilepsy<xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr"><sup>8</sup></xref> and autosomal dominant progressive deafness.<xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr"><sup>9</sup></xref> To date 5 gene members of the KCNQ family have been identified, each encoding a different KCNQ α-subunit.<xref rid="bib1 bib2 bib3 bib4 bib5" ref-type="bibr"><sup>1–5</sup></xref> Considerable diversity in KCNQ expression has been noted among tissues with channels expressed as homomultimers or heteromultimers with accessory subunits, such as the KCNE β-subunits.</p>
    <p>We determined whether a component of the outward K<sup>+</sup> current in guinea pig bladder ICC was due to KCNQ. Also, we assessed any contribution of KCNQ channels to the regulation of ICC resting membrane potential.</p>

        <title>Cell Preparation and Electrophysiological Recordings</title>
        <p>The bladder was removed from adult guinea pigs of either sex weighing 250 to 600 gm. The animals had been sacrificed by cervical dislocation or injection with pentobarbitone in accordance with Schedule 1 United Kingdom Home Office regulations. The bladders were opened and the mucosa was removed to leave the underlying detrusor. Cells were enzymatically isolated from the detrusor region, as previously described.<xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr"><sup>2</sup></xref></p>
        <p>Cells were plated to the bottom of a recording bath and constantly perfused with Hanks' physiological salt solution at room temperature. The cell of interest was continuously superfused by a drug delivery system consisting of a pipette with a tip diameter of 200 μm placed approximately 300 μm away. The solution in the drug delivery system could be switched to one containing a drug with a dead space time of less than 10 seconds. ICC were identified by the presence of lateral branches as previously described<xref rid="bib2 bib4" ref-type="bibr"><sup>2,4</sup></xref> and selected for patch clamp recordings using the whole cell or the amphotericin perforated patch technique. Patch pipette electrodes made from borosilicate glass (resistance 2 to 4 MΩ) were connected via an analog to digital/digital to analog converter (National Instruments™) to an Axopatch 1D patch clamp amplifier (Axon Instruments, Foster City, California) and a personal computer running WinWCP software (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://spider.science.strath.ac.uk/sipbs/software_ses.htm">http://spider.science.strath.ac.uk/sipbs/software_ses.htm</ext-link>). In whole cell mode after gigaseals were obtained access to the cell interior was gained by sharp suction. In perforated patch recordings the cell was given a test depolarization from −60 to 40 mV every 30 seconds until the outward current developed to its maximal amplitude. Series resistance and the capacitive surge were compensated using circuitry from the Axopatch 1D amplifier.</p>

        <title>KCNQ Blockers and ICC Outward Currents</title>
        <p>McCloskey identified a BK and voltage dependent delayed rectifier K<sup>+</sup> current in ICC and described a noninactivating, voltage dependent unidentified component.<xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr"><sup>4</sup></xref> The possibility that novel KCNQ currents might contribute to the unidentified portion of ICC outward current was explored by testing the effect of KCNQ pharmacological drugs. Detrusor ICC were voltage clamped using K<sup>+</sup> filled pipettes containing 5 mM EGTA and 3 mM ATP to inhibit BK and K<sub>ATP</sub> channels, respectively, and depolarized to evoke outward currents. This approach was successfully used by Yeung and Greenwood.<xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr"><sup>10</sup></xref> It avoids the use of channel blocking drugs, which may interfere with the conductance of interest. Outward currents were dominant, although inward Ca<sup>2+</sup> currents were also present. Mean ICC capacitance was 59 ± 1 pF in 80 cells.</p>
        <p>A depolarizing step from −60 to 40 mV elicited noninactivating currents (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">fig. 1</xref>,  <italic>A</italic>). The KCNQ blocker XE991<xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr"><sup>11</sup></xref> decreased the currents in a concentration dependent manner. <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>, <italic>B</italic> shows summary data on 11 cells. XE991 (10 μM) significantly decreased the outward current from 498 ± 44 to 432 ± 39 pA and 30 μM further decreased the current to 376 ± 34 pA (each p &lt;0.05). The current-voltage relationship was examined by stepping from −60 mV to a range of potentials up to 40 mV in 10 mV increments. The resulting family of currents was decreased by 10 μM XE991 across the voltage range (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">fig. 1</xref>, <italic>C</italic>). Mean current at each potential was plotted against the test potential in the absence and presence of drug (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">fig. 1</xref>, <italic>D</italic>). Subtracting XE991 sensitive currents from control currents revealed that the XE991 sensitive KCNQ current was a voltage dependent, outwardly rectifying current that activated positive to −60 mV (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">fig. 1</xref>, <italic>E</italic>).</p>
        <p>Another 2 drugs that are often used to block KCNQ channels were tested. <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>, <italic>A</italic> shows the concentration dependent decrease in current amplitude (evoked by stepping from −60 to 40 mV) by the lesser potent analogue of XE991, linopirdine.<xref rid="bib12 bib13" ref-type="bibr"><sup>12,13</sup></xref> Although it was less effective than XE991, linopirdine (10 μM) decreased control current from 689 ± 130 to 585 ± 155 pA in 5 cells, while increasing the concentration to 30 μM further decreased the current to 435 ± 94 pA (p &gt;0.05).

        <title>KCNQ Drugs and ICC Resting Membrane Potential</title>
        <p>Cells were patched with amphotericin B filled pipettes using the modified pipette solution and studied in current clamp mode, so that the effect of KCNQ drugs on resting membrane potential could be assessed. Mean resting membrane potential in 18 ICC under these conditions was −38 ± 3 mV. While most recordings were electrically quiescent, spontaneous oscillations in resting membrane potential were observed under control conditions in 5 of 18 cells. Application of XE991 (10 μM) depolarized the membrane potential and mean depolarization in 4 cells was 18 ± 5 mV (p &lt;0.05, <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">fig. 4</xref>, <italic>A</italic>). XE991 evoked transient depolarizations before sustained depolarization in 1 of 4 cells (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">fig. 4</xref>, <italic>B</italic>).

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>KCNQ currents have classically been investigated in neuronal and cardiac cells and tissues. More recently KCNQ currents have been reported to be present in smooth muscle preparations, including the pulmonary artery,<xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr"><sup>17</sup></xref> portal vein<xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr"><sup>18</sup></xref> and mesenteric artery,<xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr"><sup>19</sup></xref> and to have a role in smooth muscle excitability and vascular tone regulation. The current study shows that, in addition to neuronal, cardiac and smooth muscle cells, ICC from guinea pig detrusor also have KCNQ currents. We recently characterized similar currents in detrusor smooth muscle, in which KCNQ currents appear to have a key role in the control of bladder spontaneous electrical and contractile activity (Anderson and McCloskey, unpublished data).</p>
      <p>In the current study KCNQ currents from bladder ICC showed many typical properties of KCNQ channels, including voltage dependence, activation positive to −60 mV, outward rectification and little inactivation. They were sensitive to inhibition by drugs commonly used to block KCNQ channels, ie XE991, linopirdine and chromanol 293B. XE991 and linopirdine have been reported to be effective KCNQ blockers, although the block was not found to be specific to a particular KCNQ channel subtype.<xref rid="bib12 bib13" ref-type="bibr"><sup>12,13</sup></xref> XE991 was more potent for decreasing the residual outward current in ICC compared with linopirdine in the current study, consistent with the findings of others.<xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr"><sup>13</sup></xref> A decrease in currents by XE991 and linopirdine similar to those in the current study were found in vascular smooth muscle cells from rat mesenteric arteries<xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr"><sup>19</sup></xref> and the rat portal vein.<xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr"><sup>10</sup></xref></p>
      <p>Further support for the existence of KCNQ currents in bladder ICC comes from experiments with the KCNQ channel openers flupirtine and MFA, which each increased outward currents, consistent with findings in rat mesenteric artery smooth muscle cells.<xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr"><sup>19</sup></xref> Flupirtine and its more potent analogue retigabine increased KCNQ/M current and decreased excitability in neurons.<xref rid="bib15 bib16" ref-type="bibr"><sup>15,16</sup></xref> Moreover, MFA was found to augment KCNQ currents by shifting the voltage activation curve to the left and slowing deactivation kinetics, leading to membrane hyperpolarization.<xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr"><sup>16</sup></xref></p>
      <p>The potential physiological significance of KCNQ currents in bladder ICC was demonstrated in current clamp studies of cell resting membrane potential. Activation of KCNQ currents in bladder ICC appears to decrease excitability since application of the channel opener flupirtine hyperpolarized ICC and inhibited the firing of spontaneous transient depolarizations. This implies that KCNQ channel opening could act as a brake, preventing electrical activity and depolarization of the cells. Consistent with this the blockade of KCNQ channels depolarized the membrane potential sufficiently to trigger firing in otherwise quiescent cells.</p>
      <p>The precise roles of ICC in the bladder have not been fully elucidated. However, several studies indicate that they act to modify or regulate the activity of neighboring SMCs.<xref rid="bib3 bib20" ref-type="bibr"><sup>3,20</sup></xref> If this is indeed the case, blockade of KCNQ channels on ICC would depolarize the ICC and subsequently affect SMCs via gap junctions or evoke Ca<sup>2+</sup> release from internal stores in ICC and, therefore, activate cellular signaling mechanisms between ICC and SMCs. Conversely KCNQ openers would hyperpolarize ICC, which would then hyperpolarize neighboring SMCs. Therefore, ICC may act to amplify the effect of KCNQ drugs on SMCs, representing a synergy of design. For example, SMC hyperpolarization by KCNQ opening while neighboring ICC remained depolarized would be unlikely to be maintained because the more positive ICC would tend to depolarize the SMCs. Thus, the presence of KCNQ channels on ICC as well as SMCs might represent a fine tuning mechanism to control bladder contractility. Streng et al reported compelling evidence for the functional role of KCNQ channels in the bladder in in vivo experiments in rats.<xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr"><sup>5</sup></xref> In their study intravesical administration of the KCNQ opener retigabine decreased baseline bladder pressures in the rat detrusor, increased micturition volume and decreased capsaicin induced detrusor overactivity. Our study supports these findings and provides electrophysiological evidence for the existence of KCNQ channels in bladder ICC. It seems feasible that the development of bladder specific KCNQ openers could provide treatment for overactive bladder. Moreover, gene mutations of KCNQ subunits, such as cardiovascular, nervous and auditory pathologies, may well underlie bladder disorders.</p>

      <title>Conclusions</title>
      <p>We investigated the hypothesis that a component of the outward K<sup>+</sup> current in guinea pig bladder ICC is mediated by KCNQ channels. ICC outward currents were decreased by KCNQ pharmacological blockers and enhanced by KCNQ channel openers. Data suggest that KCNQ currents have a role in the regulation of ICC resting membrane potential and excitability.
