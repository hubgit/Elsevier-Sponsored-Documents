      <abstract>
        <p>This study was performed in the aim to identify potential targets for the development of novel therapy to treat cancer with poor outcome or treatment efficacy. We show that the negatively charged phospholipid phosphatidylserine (PS) is exposed in the outer leaflet of their plasma membrane not only in tumor cell lines, but also in metastases and primary cultures thereof, which contrasts with a lack of PS exposure by differentiated non-tumorigenic counterparts. Studied tumor cell lines were derived from non-tumorigenic and malignant melanomas, prostate- and renal cancer, glioblastoma and a rhabdomyosarcoma. Importantly, also metastases of melanoma expose PS and there is a correlation between malignancy of melanoma cell lines from different stages of tumor progression and PS exposure. The PS exposure we found was neither of apoptotic nor of experimental artificial origin. Finally potentially malignant and non-malignant cells could be differentiated by sorting of a primary cell culture derived from a glioblastoma based on PS exposure, which has so far not been possible within one culture due to lack of a specific marker. Our data provide clear evidence that PS could serve as uniform marker of tumor cells and metastases as well as a target for novel therapeutic approaches based on e.g. PS-specific host defense derived peptides.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>Cancer is the leading cause of death worldwide (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs297/en/">http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs297/en/</ext-link>). In the last decades significant progress has been made in respect of diagnostics and therapeutic approaches. However, despite favorable advancements, state of the art chemotherapy is still not successful in many cancers. Potential toxicity and many side effects of chemotherapeutics can mainly be explained by a lack of adequate specificity for tumor cells. Chemotherapy, due to resistance and other reasons, is essentially inefficient for prostate cancer, metastatic melanoma, and bladder, kidney and pancreatic cancer. Further, the benefit of chemotherapy in general is modest, since the increase of survival rate after 5 years for all adult cancers is only by 2% <xref rid="bb0005" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>. Consistently, the search for more specific targets generally expressed within a certain tumor is a major issue in anti-cancer research. Cell membrane, growth factor receptors and proteins involved in cell–cell-signaling are of broad interest, but relatively little is known about changes in lipid composition of the cell membrane in carcinogenesis. Nevertheless, in recent years lipidomics in cancer research has gained more attention.</p>
      <p>The outer leaflet of eukaryotic plasma membranes normally comprises neutral phospholipids, like phosphatidylcholine (PC) and sphingomyelin (SM), whereas the negatively charged phospholipid phosphatidylserine (PS) as well as phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) are located in the inner leaflet <xref rid="bb0010" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>. It has been reported earlier that this asymmetry may be lost due to reduced activity of the ATP dependent phospholipid translocase, which specifically transports PS and PE between bilayer leaflets and is susceptible to oxidative injury, or due to the activation of a scramblase induced by increased intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> levels which leads to non-specific movement of phospholipids <xref rid="bb0015" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>. This loss of asymmetry results in exposure of the negatively charged PS on the surface of cancerous and other pathological cells <xref rid="bb0020 bb0025" ref-type="bibr">[4,5]</xref>, as well as apoptotic cells <xref rid="bb0030 bb0035" ref-type="bibr">[6,7]</xref> and thus PS represents a promising target for cationic host defense peptides. The fact that platelets and erythrocytes also expose PS upon activation <xref rid="bb0040" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref> seems to cause minimal side effects compared to much higher side effects observed with other applied therapies since these peptides can act specifically within the organism.</p>
      <p>Surface exposure of PS by malignant cells was shown in tumorigenic Friend erythroleukemic cells <xref rid="bb0045" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>, other leukemia and neuroblastoma cells <xref rid="bb0050" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>, malignant melanoma <xref rid="bb0055" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref> and human gastric carcinoma cells <xref rid="bb0060" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>. <italic>In vivo</italic> exposure of anionic phospholipids could be shown on the surface of endothelial cells in tumor blood vessels <xref rid="bb0065" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>. In an attempt to correlate changes in the phospholipid bilayer of malignant melanoma (MM) cell membranes with progression of these tumors Cichorek et al. showed slightly higher exposure of PS in the more progressive amelanotic transplantable hamster cell lines than in melanotic ones <xref rid="bb0070" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>. Lack of surface exposure of PS was demonstrated for non-cancer cells as normal human epidermal keratinocytes <xref rid="bb0055" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>, 3T3-fibroblasts <xref rid="bb0075" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref> and lymphocytes <xref rid="bb0050" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>.</p>
      <p>In general, apoptotic cells exposing PS in the outer leaflet of the plasma membrane are specifically recognized by macrophages <xref rid="bb0030 bb0035" ref-type="bibr">[6,7]</xref> and dendritic cells <xref rid="bb0080" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>. However, tumor cells, although exposing PS, circumvent apoptosis and prevent the recognition by macrophages <xref rid="bb0085 bb0090" ref-type="bibr">[17,18]</xref>. Therefore, membrane-active peptides have been proposed to constitute a promising approach in the development of anticancer drugs <xref rid="bb0050 bb0095 bb0100 bb0105" ref-type="bibr">[10,19–21]</xref>. The positively charged small peptides are produced by the innate immune system and are able to discriminate between different cell membranes. These host defense peptides specifically interact with negatively charged lipids on their target cell membrane <xref rid="bb0110 bb0115 bb0120 bb0125" ref-type="bibr">[22–25]</xref>, which would minimize side effects upon treatment and could reach all cancer types exposing PS, even those resistant to conventional chemotherapy.</p>
      <p>The discovery of a specific target generally expressed within all tumor types as well as by metastases would be a major success in cancer research. Therefore, the present study focuses on PS exposure of malignancies with poor outcome or treatment efficacy, which require new pharmaceutical therapies and would enormously benefit from cancer specific peptide drugs. This study has to be considered as an extension of the pioneering work by Utsugi and coworkers <xref rid="bb0045 bb0055" ref-type="bibr">[9,11]</xref> who proved PS expression in the outer leaflet of three different tumor cell lines. We extended the study by increasing the number of cancer types and including metastases and primary cell cultures. We have therefore clearly demonstrated that PS-exposure is a general phenomenon not only in primary lesions of cancer but also in metastases, cancer cell lines and primary cultures and a by far underestimated Achilles’ heel of cancer.</p>

          <p>Glioblastoma (U87-mg) purchased from CLS (Cell Line Service Heidelberg, Germany) and rhabdomyosarcoma cell lines (TE671) purchased from ECAAC (Health Protection Agency Culture Collections Salisbury, UK) were cultured in Dulbecco's Modified Eagle Medium (DMEM, Invitrogen, UK) with addition of 2 mM glutamine, 10% FBS (fetal bovine serum; Lot A10109-0523, PAA Laboratory, Pasching, Austria) and 1% Pen/Strep (Penicillin/Streptomycin, PAA Laboratory, Austria). Kidney carcinoma (769-P) and prostate adenocarcinoma cell lines (LNCaP) purchased from CLS were cultured in RPMI1640 medium (Invitrogen, UK) with addition of 10% FBS, 2 mM <sc>l</sc>-glutamine, 1% PenStrep and 1 mM sodium pyruvate (Invitrogen, UK).</p>
          <p>The melanocytic cell lines were kindly provided by Dr. Meenhard Herlyn (The Wistar Institute, Philadelphia, PA). The primary human melanoma cell lines SBcl2, WM35 and metastatic melanoma cell lines WM9, WM164 were maintained in RPMI (Sigma, St. Louis, MO) supplemented with 2% FBS, 2% <sc>l</sc>-glutamine and 1% Pen/Strep.</p>
          <p>All cell lines were purchased frozen and thawed freshly before the experiments. During culturing they were kept in a 5% CO<sub>2</sub> atmosphere at 37 °C. At 90% confluence cell cultures were passaged with accutase (PAA, Pasching, Austria). All cell cultures were periodically checked for mycoplasma and passaged in the laboratory no longer than 1 month after first thawing.</p>

          <p>A surgical specimen of primary glioblastoma (GBM), histologically independently verified by two pathologists (GFAP positive, Ki67 index above 50%), was blended mechanically and transferred to culture flask containing growth medium (DMEM, 10% FBS, 1% <sc>l</sc>-glutamine, 1% Pen/Strep, 1% Amphotericin B; PAA Laboratory, Austria) <xref rid="bb0130" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>. Tumorigenicity has been shown in nude mice. A melanoma metastasis to the brain (MMB), was blended mechanically and transferred to a culture flask containing growth medium (RPMI, 5% FBS, 1% <sc>l</sc>-glutamine, 1%Pen/Strep, 1% Amphotericin). Human melanocytes (FOM101), derived from human foreskin were cultured in human melanocytes growth medium (PromoCell GmbH, Heidelberg, Germany). Normal human dermal fibroblasts (NHDF) purchased from PromoCell GmbH (Heidelberg, Germany) were cultured in fibroblast growth medium 2 (PromoCell GmbH, Heidelberg, Germany).</p>
          <p>Synoviocytes were isolated from synovium of Osteoarthritis (OA) patients undergoing joint replacement surgery, who fulfilled the criteria of the 1986 American College of Rheumatology. Random biopsies of synovial membrane were obtained aseptically from joints of OA patients. Synovial membrane tissue was separated macroscopically from ligaments, fat and other non-synovial tissue, minced in 1 mm slices and washed with PBS (phosphate buffered saline; GIBCO Invitrogen) supplemented with Pen/Strep and 0.25 μg Amphotericin B (PAA Laboratory, Austria). Synovial membrane specimens were rinsed several times with 1× PBS, finely dissected and digested with 0.2% Collegenase B (Roche Diagnostics, Germany) in high glucose Dulbecco's-modified Eagle's medium (DMEM-HG; GIBCO Invitrogen), containing 10% FBS, 1% <sc>l</sc>-glutamine, Pen/Strep and Amphotericin B (PAA Laboratory, Austria). Following overnight incubation at 37 °C, the cell suspension was filtered on a nylon membrane (Cell Strainer 40 μm; BD Bioscience). Cells were collected by centrifugation, washed twice, re-suspended in DMEM-HG growth medium, plated in culture flasks and allowed to attach for 3 days. OA cells were authenticated by flow cytometry.</p>
          <p>Primary culture T22 was obtained after surgical excision of a Rhabdomyosarcoma, histologically specified by a pathologist. The tissue was minced mechanically, washed twice and transferred to Collagenase B and transferred to culture flask containing growth medium (DMEM-HG, 10% FBS, 1% <sc>l</sc>-glutamine, 1% Pen/Strep).</p>
          <p>Primary cell cultures were used between passages 2 and 6 (except for FOM101 and GBM, which were passaged up to 12). All cell cultures were periodically checked for mycoplasma. All patients consented and ethics approval for the use of patient-derived material was given by the local research ethics committee.</p>

        <p>Cells (2 × 10<sup>4</sup>) were seeded onto 8 wells chamber slides (ibidy GmbH, Martinsried, Germany) and grown in 300 μl medium for 2–3 days in a confluent layer. Medium was removed and cells were washed twice with 1x Annexin binding buffer (ABB) of Vybrant Apoptosis Assay Kit #2 (Molecular Probes™, Invitrogen). 5 μl Annexin V-Alexa Fluor 488 (staining PS exposing cells) and 5 μl PI (staining DNA of necrotic cells) in 300 μl ABB were added and incubated at room temperature in the dark. After incubation cells were washed twice with ABB to remove unbound Annexin V-Alexa Fluor 488 and covered with ABB. A Leica DMI6000 B with IMC in connection with a Leica DFC360 FX camera and AF 6000 software was used for imaging.</p>

      <p>In the present study, we evaluated anionic phospholipids exposed by cancer cells as targets for cationic host defense peptides and thereof derived antitumor peptides. In particular, the specificity and significance of the presence of negatively charged PS in the outer leaflet of the plasma membrane of tumor cells and metastases of cell lines and primary cultures were investigated.</p>

        <title>Cancer cells and metastases specifically and significantly expose PS</title>
        <p>A standard Annexin V affinity assay, frequently used for detection of apoptosis, has been applied to specifically elucidate the exposure of PS by malignant melanoma, soft tissue, prostate, kidney and brain cancer cell lines. However, to avoid membrane stress, adherent cells were detached before Annexin V-FITC binding with accutase/low EDTA instead of the standard trypsin/EDTA detachment, since trypsinization or scrapping of the cells was shown to lead to increase of Annexin V binding (PS exposure) (PhD thesis Maximilian Martin Gemeinhardt, Munich, Faculty of Medicine, 2008). This is probably due to non-repairable membrane damage.</p>
        <p>As demonstrated by flow cytometry the different cancer cell lines of rhabdomyosarcoma, a malignant soft tissue tumor of mesenchymal origin (TE671), prostate cancer (LNCaP), renal cell cancer (769-P) (<xref rid="f0005" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>), melanoma of primary (SBcl-2, WM35) and metastatic lesions (WM9 and WM164) and glioblastoma (U-87 mg) (<xref rid="f0005 f0010" ref-type="fig">Figs. 1 and 2</xref>) exposed significant amounts of PS compared to non-tumorigenic cells (<xref rid="f0005" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref> and supplementary Fig. 1S). This is indicated by selective binding of Annexin V-FITC to PS on the surface of tumor cells, revealed by a strong shift in fluorescence intensity of Annexin V-FITC labeled tumor cells in contrast to unlabeled tumor cells compared to a negligible shift of the labeled corresponding “non-tumor” control cells like differentiated synoviocyte cells of OA patients (non-tumor counterpart to TE671), melanocytes derived of foreskin (FOM101) (<xref rid="f0005" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>) and normal human dermal fibroblasts (NHDF) (supplementary Fig. 1S).</p>

        <p>To exclude false positive results by Annexin V labeled necrotic cells, the assays were always performed in the presence of propidium iodide (PI) staining necrotic cells that exhibit membrane damage and therefore also internalize Annexin V labels. Thus, PS levels referred to are derived from Annexin positive, but PI negative cells. In types studied, PI positive necrotic cells (Q2, supplements, Fig. 2S) constituted only a minor population of less than 5%, whereas Annexin positive cells (Q4, supplements, Fig. 2S) have to be ascribed to cells exposing PS. Thus, cells studied were not undergoing necrosis. In summary, results confirmed a cancer cell specific high exposure of PS by all the cancer cell lines investigated.</p>

        <title>Correlation of level of PS exposure with malignancy and cancer type</title>
        <p>To determine a possible correlation between PS exposure and tumor progression, four human malignant melanoma (MM) cell lines isolated from different stages were compared to melanocytes (<xref rid="t0005" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>).</p>
        <p>Fluorescence spectroscopy experiments enabled a comparison of the PS levels (Annexin V-FITC bound) exposed by different MM cell lines (<xref rid="t0005" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). Results revealed a correlation between tumor malignancy and PS levels exposed. For instance, a nearly doubling in PS exposure was observed by WM35 <xref rid="bb0140" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref> compared to SBcl-2, a non-tumorigenic cell line in SCID mice <xref rid="bb0145" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref>. In SBcl-2 cells PS exposure was increased 4-fold compared to melanocytes whereas in cancer cells of higher malignancy, WM9 and WM164 of metastatic lesions, exposure was increased by 8–11 fold. Thus, a clear correlation between malignant potential within a tumor entity and the level of PS exposed was found. These results are in agreement with data obtained by flow cytometry (<xref rid="f0005" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>) (<xref rid="s0075" ref-type="sec">Section 3.1</xref>.) (median deviation, supplements, Fig. 3S).</p>

(median deviation, <xref rid="f0015" ref-type="fig">supplements, Fig. 3S</xref>).</p>
        <p>Some striking differences were observed in terms of levels of PS exposed by other cancer types. In the case of the rhabdomyosarcoma cell line TE671, the amount of PS exposed was significantly higher in comparison to malignant melanoma or 769-P cells (<xref rid="t0005" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>), which suggests that this cancer type may be an even better candidate for efficient treatment by PS-specific peptides.</p>
        <p>The PS level exposed by the primary cell culture of a glioblastoma (GBM) (see also <xref rid="s0085" ref-type="sec">Section 3.3</xref>.) is lower than that of melanoma cell lines WM9 or WM164, which is quite feasible, since it is not yet a homogenous tumor cell line. Nevertheless, the PS level is still increased compared to melanocytes.</p>
        <p>Fluorescence labeling of vital cells (<xref rid="f0005" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>) grown on slides proved that PS (Annexin V-Alexa Fluor 488 bound, green fluorescence) is exposed by MM cells, even when not being detached before labeling (like for flow cytometry) and therefore “not stressed”, whereas non neoplastic melanocytes showed no Annexin V binding, thus no PS exposure. Furthermore, the quite interesting observation could be made that PS on the surface of MM cells appeared to be clustered and not distributed homogeneously over the plasma membrane, as would be the case if Annexin V stained PS in the inner leaflet of necrotic cells. Thus, to exclude false positive results by necrotic cells, cells were always co-labeled with PI, but only a negligible number of PI-stained necrotic cells were detected.</p>

        <title>PS exposure — not an artifact of cell lines!</title>
        <p>Cell culturing, which comprises several passages of the cells by repeated detachment and seeding of cells, is a standard procedure for cancer cells. The studied non-tumor cells however were primary cultures that can only be passaged a few times. Therefore tumor cell lines could suffer membrane damage through cell culturing procedures. In order to exclude this experimentally artificial reason for PS exposure, in addition to studies on cancer cell lines we also investigated primary cancer cell cultures of a glioblastoma (GBM) (correlating to glioblastoma cell line U-87 mg), primary cells of a rhabdomyosarcoma (T22) (correlating to rhabdomyosarcoma cell line TE671) and a malignant melanoma metastasis to the brain (MMB) (correlating to melanoma cell line WM35) (<xref rid="f0010" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>). The studied primary tumor cells, like the cell lines showed significant binding of Annexin V-FITC. These results clearly indicate that not only cancer cell lines but also primary cell cultures of malignant tumors and even metastases expose significant levels of PS. This further demonstrates that PS exposure to the outer lipid leaflet of cancer cells is not caused by cell culturing procedures but is an original and permanent characteristic of cancer cells. As mentioned, it has to be taken into account that primary cell cultures of tumors also include non neoplastic cells with a certain extent of stromal cells and therefore the PS level exposed can be lower compared to homogenous cancer cell lines. This is for instance nicely demonstrated by the primary cell culture of the melanoma metastases (MMB), which shows less shift of the Annexin V labeled cells (<xref rid="f0010" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>) meaning slightly reduced PS exposure compared to melanoma cell line WM35, but still significantly increased levels compared to differentiated melanocytes (<xref rid="f0005" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>).</p>

        <title>PS — a potential common marker of cancer cells, but “no reliable eat me” signal</title>
        <p>There is no universal tumor marker known so far. To prove that PS could really be an accurate marker for all cancer cells, we tried to distinguish between tumor and non-tumor cells just by the characteristic of exposure or non-exposure of PS, respectively.</p>
        <p>Therefore, a primary cell culture of a histologically verified glioblastoma (WHO grade IV) was evaluated. Even when the specimen for the culture is obtained from the center of the tumor, it is very likely to contain non neoplastic cells as well as glial tumor cells, like microglia and stromal cells, macrophages and maybe reactive glial cells. A fact being of advantage in this case, since we should be able to observe malignant and to some extent benign cell types in one culture. Microscopic inspection of the cell culture was insufficient to distinguish between the different cell types.</p>
        <p>After Annexin V labeling and exclusion of necrotic factors by PI, strongly increased PS levels on the cell surface of a part of the cells were detected. In a second step the cells were sorted using a FACS ARIA II TM cell sorter according to their Annexin V binding events. It was possible to obtain Annexin positive (A+) and Annexin negative (A−) cells. These different cell types were returned to culture to let the cells recover. The two different cultures were then investigated by electron microscopy (<xref rid="f0015" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>) and immunocytochemistry using the proliferation marker Mib-1 (<xref rid="f0020" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref>).</p>
        <p>The electron microscopy pictures revealed that the Annexin positive cells (<xref rid="f0015" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref> C–H) (potential glial tumor cells carrying the PS marker) showed some homogenous morphological characteristics indicating that these cells were tumor cells. Size and shape of nuclei of Annexin positive cells (<xref rid="f0015" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref> C and D) were partially changed compared to those of Annexin negative cells (<xref rid="f0015" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref> A and B), indicated by an elongated or polymorphic shape and sizes up to 25 μm, which is twice the normal size. Increased nucleus/plasma ratios, as well as polymorphic nuclei are characteristics of tumor cells. Nevertheless, also the few Annexin negative cells exhibited quite large nuclei (10–15 μm), potentially representing reactive astrocytes. Furthermore, a structural change of the plasma membrane of the Annexin positive cells could be seen, characterized by a quite diffuse cellular border (D, E, F, arrows Cell Bor) compared to a sharp border exhibited by Annexin negative cells (A and B). This membrane feature is probably reflecting a difference between tumor and stromal cells. Another characteristic of the Annexin positive cells was a strong increase in formation of ribosomes and vesicles (F and H, arrow Rib) and an increase in exocytosis of vesicles (F, arrow Ves Ex), a feature of GBM cells described in detail recently by Skog et al. <xref rid="bb0150" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref>. For better representation of intracellular changes only parts of cells are shown, whole cell images before sorting are presented in the supplements (Fig. 4S).</p>

        <p>The aforementioned findings were supported by slowly growing Annexin negative cells in contrast to well proliferating Annexin positive cells and the fact that proliferation marker Mib-1 (<xref rid="f0020" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref>) was slightly higher expressed in A+ than in A− cells, a feature of glioblastoma cells. However, it has to be noted that the amount of Annexin negative cells within the primary cell culture was quite low.</p>
        <p>Further the Annexin positive cells of glioblastoma were checked for morphological changes due to apoptosis, like swelling of mitochondria, typical apoptotic blebbing or condensation of chromatin (<xref rid="f0015" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref> G, D, E, F, arrow Mit (normal mitochondria)). The Annexin positive cells however were lacking all these signs of apoptosis. This was also supported by caspase-3 cleavage assays with the melanoma cancer cell lines used within this study (<xref rid="f0025" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref>) revealing no significant caspase-3 cleavage (below 5%), thus excluding PS exposure of studied cancer cells to be a sign of cells undergoing apoptosis. This is further confirmed by a positive control, where apoptosis was induced in the melanoma cell line WM35 by 72 h treatment with a plant extract of <italic>Onosma paniculatum</italic> resulting in significant increase of caspase-3 cleavage from 2.3% by untreated up to 38% by treated cells, indicated by a strong shift in fluorescence intensity. Inducibility of cell death in a caspase dependent manner by treatment with the plant extract was also reported for the studied melanoma cell lines SBcl-2, WM35, WM9 and WM164 recently by Rinner et al. <xref rid="bb0135" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>.</p>

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>After several decades of cancer research no common marker for malignant cells has been identified so far, which would offer many possibilities, not only for therapy, but also for fast and accurate diagnosis. Already in 1991 Utsugi et al. <xref rid="bb0055" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref> reported about elevated expression of PS in the outer leaflet of human tumor cells. In 2002 Ran et al. <xref rid="bb0065" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref> showed that the monoclonal antibody 9D2 and Annexin V, the natural ligand to anionic phospholipids, specifically localized to tumor vessels and tumor cells in and around necrotic regions after i.v. injection into tumor-bearing mice, whereas none of the blood vessels in normal tissues had detectable externalized anionic phospholipids. Our study strongly supports these findings and more importantly clearly demonstrates that exposure of PS to the outer leaflet of membranes is not restricted to blood vessels but is a general phenomenon for cancer plasma membranes independently on cancer type and is also valid for metastases and many cancer types including those with poor outcome or treatability, like glioblastoma or malignant melanoma. Thus, the anionic phospholipid PS could serve as a common cancer marker as well as a therapeutic target. Since the standard labeling technique with Annexin V requires an intact plasma membrane and apoptotic or necrobiotic cells also show increased levels of PS in their outer leaflet, there may be some limitations. Therefore in our study “false positive” results by increased Annexin V binding to PS by cells undergoing apoptosis had to be excluded. In fact, the cancer cells tested showed elevated PS levels, but without any sign of apoptosis. This is an important aspect, since it is mainly assumed that cancer cells expose higher levels of PS due to their higher rate of cell division and apoptosis, as e.g. described by Boersma et al. <xref rid="bb0155" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref>. On the other hand PS exposed could mean that cancer cells should be fated to die but are clever enough to avoid the last step of being killed. As mentioned earlier there are several ways for cancer cells to prevent apoptosis like melanoma cells inhibiting the expression of the gene encoding Apaf-1, the apoptotic protease activating factor-1 <xref rid="bb0085" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>.</p>
      <p>It is not fully understood how and why cancer cells expose PS to the outer plasma membrane leaflet. When separating phospholipids of a total cell lipid extract of human melanocytes (FOM101) and two melanoma cell lines (SBcl-2 and WM164) by two-dimensional thin-layer chromatography and quantification by the method of Broekhuyse <xref rid="bb0160" ref-type="bibr">[32]</xref>, no increase in the total amount of PS was found in the cancer cells (data not shown). Therefore, not the overall PS content but only the asymmetric PS distribution in the plasma membrane seems to get lost. It has been reported that the combined action of an amino phospholipid translocase, responsible for the specific movement of PS and PE to the inner leaflet of plasma membranes, and a less specific floppase, responsible for the movement of PS and PC to the outside, both dependent on ATP, seems to equip the cell with a mechanism that corrects for alterations in lipid distribution to avoid potential pathological consequences <xref rid="bb0025" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>. Nevertheless, as reported, inactivation of these activities <italic>in vitro</italic> did not result in loss of asymmetry. However, activation of a third protein, the lipid scramblase, by influx of Ca<sup>2+</sup> into the cytoplasm can cause a rapid transbilayer phospholipid mixing leading to a nearly symmetric distribution across the membrane bilayer <xref rid="bb0025" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>. Thus, cellular changes like depletion of ATP and/or influx of Ca<sup>2+</sup> into the cytoplasm seem to be important factors accounting for exposure of PS. Furthermore, it has been proposed by Ran et al. <xref rid="bb0065" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref> that injury and activation of tumor endothelium by cytokines and reactive oxygen species might induce PS exposure of tumor vessels. As mentioned in <xref rid="s0080" ref-type="sec">Section 3.2.</xref>, we were able to observe by fluorescence microscopy that PS, visualized by Annexin V-Alexa Fluor 488, was localized in clusters on the plasma membrane of cancer cells. Interestingly some of these PS exposing clusters budded off the cells were quite mobile and even moved from one cell to the other in the form of small PS exposing blebs (unpublished observation). In this context it is of interest to note that loss of membrane asymmetry is often accompanied by blebbing and subsequent shedding of lipid-symmetric microvesicles from the cell surface <xref rid="bb0165 bb0170" ref-type="bibr">[33,34]</xref>. It is known that eukaryotic cells are able to perform intercellular communication by e.g., exosomes <xref rid="bb0175" ref-type="bibr">[35]</xref>. If these vesicles still carry the PS marker, one could then assume that host defense peptides, which can target PS would also be able to prevent possible intercellular communication between cancer cells.</p>
      <p>Definitely, PS constitutes an Achilles' heel of cancer cells, because the anionic lipid represents a cancer type independent target for host defense peptides that rapidly kill cells exposing negatively charged lipids. A number of studies revealed that cationic amphipathic peptides specifically interact with PS containing membranes <xref rid="bb0050 bb0180 bb0185 bb0190" ref-type="bibr">[10,36–38]</xref>. So far highly active antimicrobial peptides derived from host defense could be designed to selectively target bacterial membranes <xref rid="bb0195 bb0200 bb0205 bb0210 bb0215" ref-type="bibr">[39–43]</xref>, whereas antitumor peptides to target cancer cell membranes are in development <xref rid="bb0100 bb0120 bb0185 bb0220 bb0225" ref-type="bibr">[20,24,37,44,45]</xref>. The high levels of exposed PS found in our study for cancer cell lines, derived from metastatic lesions, suggest that these peptides can even be beneficial as a therapeutic intervention in the metastatic cascade, which is difficult so far. Furthermore, all cancer types including cancer with poor prognosis and treatability, like glioblastoma and melanoma, amongst others, would highly benefit using the PS target for novel approaches in diagnosis and therapy. Successful sorting of a primary culture of a glioblastoma within this study gives hope for possible differentiation between tumor and non-tumor cells and selective targeted therapy.</p>

      <title>Conclusions</title>
      <p>Our study constitutes an extension of previous work <xref rid="bb0055" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref> regarding cancer types with a focus on cancer with poor outcome and treatment efficacy, including metastases and primary cell cultures using another assay. We show that PS exposure is also a characteristic of metastases, a very important aspect regarding therapy. Furthermore, we compared several primary cancer cell cultures with correlating cell lines to rule out cell culturing effects on the membrane and to prove originality of PS exposure. Cancer specific PS exposure was not a sign of apoptosis. By using PS as a marker it was possible to distinguish within a primary culture of glioblastoma between potential malignant and benign cells.</p>
      <p>The study aimed at supplying evidence for a uniform and novel target for cancer therapy in the form of the negatively charged lipid phosphatidylserine. We prove that PS is specifically exposed by cancer cells and metastases, which delivers the important basis and target for the further development of cationic antitumor peptide drugs, to one day support or even partially substitute chemotherapy.</p>

Plots indicate a strong binding of Annexin V to PS on tumor cell lines. Second panel: Flow cytometry plots of Annexin V-FITC/PI labeled (black filled) and unlabeled cells (grey line) comprising differentiated control cells of primary cultures (diff pcc) of melanocytes (FOM101) and melanoma cell lines (cl) of primary lesions (pl) (nt non-tumorigenic) (SBcl-2) and more highly malignant melanoma metastases (met) (WM9 and WM164). Annexin V binds significantly to melanoma cell lines of primary and metastatic lesions. Fluorescence microscopy pictures (overlay of bright field and fluorescence channels) of melanocytes and melanoma cell lines indicate specific binding of Annexin V-Alexa Fluor 488 (green) to PS on the outside of melanoma cells. No PI (red) is integrated assuring integrity of cells studied.</p>
