      <abstract>
        <p>Mechanisms underlying the vascular differentiation of human bone marrow stromal cells (HBMSCs) and their contribution to neovascularisation are poorly understood. We report the essential role of cell density-induced signals in directing HBMSCs along endothelial or smooth muscle lineages. Plating HBMSCs at high density rapidly induced Notch signaling, which initiated HBMSC commitment to a vascular progenitor cell population expressing markers for both vascular lineages. Notch also induced VEGF-A, which inhibited vascular smooth muscle commitment while consolidating differentiation to endothelial cells with cobblestone morphology and characteristic endothelial markers and functions. These mechanisms can be exploited therapeutically to regulate HBMSCs during neovascularisation.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>Human bone marrow stromal cells (HBMSCs) have therapeutic potential in cell transplantation and tissue engineering. In addition to their anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory characteristics (<xref rid="bb0090 bb0045" ref-type="bibr">Lee et al., 2009a; Casiraghi et al., 2010</xref>), they have the capacity to differentiate directly along skeletal and other mesenchymal lineages (<xref rid="bb0120 bb0015" ref-type="bibr">Pittenger et al., 1999; Augello and De Bari, 2010</xref>). A major challenge now is to define the mechanisms that regulate their differentiation along vascular endothelial cell (EC) and smooth muscle cell (vSMC) lineages.</p>
      <p>Cultured HBMSCs typically possess some characteristics of synthetic proliferative vSMCs. In particular, they express the early contractile marker smooth muscle alpha actin (αSMA), as well as calponin and smoothelin-B (<xref rid="bb0025" ref-type="bibr">Ball et al., 2004</xref>). Stimuli shown to induce the differentiation of HBMSCs towards vSMCs include mechanical strain (<xref rid="bb0075" ref-type="bibr">Kurpinski et al., 2006</xref>), inhibition of DNA methylation (<xref rid="bb0145" ref-type="bibr">Wakitani et al., 1995</xref>), and transforming growth factor (TGF)β and Notch signaling (<xref rid="bb0080" ref-type="bibr">Kurpinski et al., 2010</xref>). Other studies have indicated that HBMSCs have the potential to differentiate towards EC lineages (<xref rid="bb0005 bb0020 bb0050 bb0055 bb0100 bb0110 bb0115 bb0140 bb0150 bb0160 bb0165 bb0170" ref-type="bibr">Al-Khaldi et al., 2003; Bai et al., 2009; Chen et al., 2009; Chung et al., 2009; Lozito et al., 2009; Ohata et al., 2009; Oswald et al., 2004; Siekmann et al., 2008; Wu et al., 2005a; Xu et al., 2009; Yue et al., 2008; Zhang et al., 2008</xref>). In many of these studies, HBMSCs exposed over days to exogenous vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF-A) showed evidence of differentiation towards ECs. However, HBMSCs do not always express vascular endothelial growth factor receptors (VEGFRs) (<xref rid="bb0050 bb0115 bb0030" ref-type="bibr">Chen et al., 2009; Oswald et al., 2004; Ball et al., 2007</xref>). Notch signaling has also been shown to direct HBMSCs towards an EC fate when activated experimentally using recombinant ligands, chemical exposure, or expression constructs (<xref rid="bb0110 bb0140 bb0160 bb0170" ref-type="bibr">Ohata et al., 2009; Siekmann et al., 2008; Xu et al., 2009; Zhang et al., 2008</xref>).</p>
      <p>Notch and VEGF signaling coordinate endothelial cell activity during vascular development, arterio-venous specification, vessel branching and endothelial tip cell formation (<xref rid="bb0065 bb0085 bb0040 bb0135 bb0070" ref-type="bibr">Gridley, 2007; Lawson et al., 2001; Boulton et al., 2008; Roukens et al., 2010; Jakobsson et al., 2010</xref>). We have investigated how these signaling mechanisms also direct the commitment of HBMSCs toward vascular ECs or vSMCs. We report that plating HBMSCs at high density rapidly stimulates Notch signaling, which induces vascular progenitor cells with the capacity to give rise to either EC or vSMC lineages. VEGF-A is not essential for the initiation of HBMSC differentiation to ECs but regulates the fate decision between EC and vSMC lineages. These mechanistic insights may be exploited in therapeutic applications of HBMSCs.</p>

        <title>HBMSCs plated and cultured at high density differentiated toward endothelial cells</title>
        <p>Cell density can regulate the morphology and differentiation of HBMSCs (<xref rid="bb0025 bb0105" ref-type="bibr">Ball et al., 2004; McBeath et al., 2004</xref>). Using HBMSCs which could be induced to differentiate toward adipocytes, osteocytes, or chondrocytes (Supplementary Fig. S1), we studied the impact of plating HBMSCs at high cell density on their differentiation toward ECs, monitoring morphology (<xref rid="f0005" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>A), specific functional properties (<xref rid="f0005" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>B), and expression of a panel of characteristic endothelial markers (<xref rid="f0005" ref-type="fig">Figs. 1</xref>C and D).</p>
        <p>HBMSCs plated at high density and cultured for 14 days (<xref rid="f0005" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>AIII) adopted a cobblestone-like morphology comparable to that of human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) (<xref rid="f0005" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>AIV), whereas HBMSCs cultured under standard conditions for 48 h (<xref rid="f0005" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>AI), or at low cell density for 14 days (<xref rid="f0005" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>AII), maintained a spindle-shaped morphology.</p>
        <p>HBMSCs plated at high density and cultured for 28 days displayed low density lipoprotein (LDL) uptake in approximately 53% of cells analysed (<xref rid="f0005" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>BIII), and VCAM-1 was also induced in response to TNFα (<xref rid="f0005" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>BVI). In contrast, HBMSCs cultured under standard conditions for 48 h did not display LDL uptake (<xref rid="f0005" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>BII) or VCAM-1 induction in response to TNFα (<xref rid="f0005" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>BV). As expected, HUVECs as positive control cells exhibited EC functional characteristics of LDL uptake (<xref rid="f0005" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>BI) and induction of VCAM-1 in response to TNFα (<xref rid="f0005" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>BIV).</p>
        <p>The distribution of the EC markers VE-cadherin, PECAM-1, vWF, and VEGFR1 in HBMSCs was examined by immunofluorescence microscopy. HBMSCs plated at high density and cultured for 14 or 28 days displayed prominent EC marker immunostaining (<xref rid="f0005" ref-type="fig">Figs. 1</xref>CIII and VI, DIII and VI). In contrast, HBMSCs cultured under standard conditions for 48 h displayed little or no immunofluorescence for the EC markers examined (<xref rid="f0005" ref-type="fig">Figs. 1</xref>CII and V, DII and V). As expected, HUVECs as positive control cells expressed the characteristic markers VE-cadherin (<xref rid="f0005" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>CI), PECAM-1 (<xref rid="f0005" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>CIV), vWF (<xref rid="f0005" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>DI), and VEGFR1 (<xref rid="f0005" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>DIV).</p>
      </sec>
      <sec id="s0020">
        <title>High density HBMSCs expressed endothelial and smooth muscle cell markers by 24 h</title>
        <p>As plating at high cell density for up to 28 days induced HBMSCs to adopt an endothelial phenotype (<xref rid="f0005" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>), we further investigated the time scale of these cellular changes by examining the expression of vascular cell markers following HBMSC culture at high density for 24 h and 3 days. The expression of EC (vWF, VEGFR1 and PECAM-1) (<xref rid="f0010" ref-type="fig">Figs. 2</xref>A–C) and vSMC (αSMA, calponin, smoothelin-B, and SM-MHC-1) (<xref rid="f0010" ref-type="fig">Figs. 2</xref>D–G) markers were analysed by immunoblot analysis. Compared to HBMSCs cultured at low density for 24 h (lane 1), culturing HBMSCs at high density (lane 2) not only induced the expression of the EC markers vWF (<xref rid="f0010" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>A), VEGFR1 (<xref rid="f0010" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>B), and PECAM-1 (<xref rid="f0010" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>C), but markedly up-regulated the expression of vSMC markers α-SMA (<xref rid="f0010" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>D), calponin (<xref rid="f0010" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>E), smoothelin-B (<xref rid="f0010" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>F), and SM-MHC-1 (<xref rid="f0010" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>G). To determine whether individual HBMSCs were expressing both EC and vSMC markers, double-labeling immunofluorescence analysis was conducted (<xref rid="f0010" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>H). This analysis clearly demonstrated that individual HBMSCs were coexpressing EC and vSMC markers following culture at high cell density for 24 h. Thus, both EC and vSMC markers were enhanced within 24 h of plating HBMSCs at high density, indicating a vascular progenitor phenotype with potential to form ECs or vSMCs.</p>
      </sec>
      <sec id="s0025">
        <title>High density HBMSCs enhanced endothelial markers but down-regulated smooth muscle cell markers by 3 days</title>
        <p>HBMSC expression of vascular markers was further examined after 3 days. Compared to HBMSCs cultured at low density, the level of VEGF-A secreted by HBMSCs at high cell density, normalised against corresponding β-actin levels, was significantly increased over a 3-day period (<xref rid="f0015" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>A). This enhanced VEGF-A secretion also coincided with a significant increase in the expression of EC markers (<xref rid="f0015" ref-type="fig">Figs. 3</xref>B and C); however, in comparison, expression of vSMC markers SM-MHC-1 (<xref rid="f0015" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>D) and smoothelin-B (<xref rid="f0015" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>E) dramatically decreased by 3 days. Thus, sustained culture of HBMSCs plated at high density promoted EC differentiation but inhibited vSMC differentiation.</p>
      </sec>
      <sec id="s0030">
        <title>Notch signaling induced vascular progenitor cells and VEGF-A secretion</title>
        <p>Notch signaling is known to regulate vascular remodeling (<xref rid="bb0065" ref-type="bibr">Gridley, 2007</xref>). To investigate whether signaling through Notch receptors controlled the density-dependent differentiation of HBMSCs toward vascular phenotypes, Notch signaling molecules were examined up to 3 days after plating HBMSCs at high density (<xref rid="f0020" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref>). The Notch transcription factor HES-1 was not detected in HBMSCs cultured at low cell density, but was rapidly induced within 24 h of plating HBMSCs at high density, and levels remained high during 3 days culture (<xref rid="f0020" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref>A). To investigate whether Notch signaling may contribute to inducing vascular progenitor cells within 24 h, HBMSCs plated at low density or high density were immunostained for Notch receptors 1–4. Only the high density HBMSCs strongly expressed Notch receptors 1, 2, and 3, (Supplementary Fig. S2), while Notch receptor 4 was not detected (not shown). This result was confirmed by qPCR and immunoblot analysis (not shown).</p>
        <p>DAPT is a chemical inhibitor of Notch signaling that inhibits the transcription of target genes, including HES-1 (<xref rid="bb0040" ref-type="bibr">Boulton et al., 2008</xref>) (Supplementary Fig. S3A). HBMSCs plated at high density were therefore treated with DAPT for 24 h, and then the expression of markers for EC and vSMC were determined by immunoblot analysis (<xref rid="f0020" ref-type="fig">Figs. 4</xref>B–D). HBMSCs plated at high density and cultured in the presence of DAPT showed a significant decrease in VEGFR1 and vWF (<xref rid="f0020" ref-type="fig">Figs. 4</xref>B and C) and SM-MHC-1 (<xref rid="f0020" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref>D) compared to DMSO-treated control HBMSCs. In addition, the level of VEGF-A secreted by DAPT-treated HBMSCs at high density for 24 h, normalised against corresponding β-actin levels, was also significantly inhibited (<xref rid="f0020" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref>E). Thus, Notch signaling enhanced VEGF-A secretion and induced a vascular progenitor cell state.</p>
        <p>To examine whether Notch receptors 1–3 were involved in inducing vascular progenitor cells and stimulating VEGF-A secretion, siRNA knockdown was performed. The efficacy of each siRNA knockdown compared to scrambled siRNAs was confirmed by immunoblot analysis (Supplementary Fig. S3B). The specificity of each siRNA Notch receptor knockdown was confirmed by reprobing the blots for a nontarget Notch receptor, which revealed unchanged protein levels in each case (Supplementary Fig. S3B). Knockdown of Notch receptors was therefore used to investigate which Notch receptors were involved in regulating the expression of vascular markers in HBMSCs plated at high density for 24 h (<xref rid="f0020" ref-type="fig">Figs. 4</xref>F–I). Knockdown of Notch receptor 1, 2, or 3 demonstrated a significant decrease both in VEGFR1 expression (<xref rid="f0020" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref>F) and in VEGF-A secretion (<xref rid="f0020" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref>I). Knockdown of Notch receptor 1 or 2 significantly inhibited vWF expression (<xref rid="f0020" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref>G, lanes 2 and 3), while knockdown of Notch receptors 1 or 3 significantly inhibited SM-MHC-1 expression (<xref rid="f0020" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref>H, lanes 2 and 4).</p>
        <p>Thus, Notch signaling activated by plating HBMSCs at high cell density is required for induction of vascular progenitor cells and commitment toward ECs.</p>
      </sec>
      <sec id="s0035">
        <title>Notch activation stimulated HBMSCs at low density to express EC markers</title>
        <p>We examined whether activation of Notch signaling could induce the vascular potential of HBMSCs plated and cultured at low cell density. Notch signaling can be activated by treating cells with cation chelators, which cause the rapid shedding of the Notch extracellular domain, thereby increasing Notch receptor 1 intranuclear staining and transcription of a nuclear mediator of Notch signaling (<xref rid="bb0130 bb0010 bb0125" ref-type="bibr">Rand et al., 2000; Aster et al., 1999; Rand et al., 1997</xref>). HBMSCs plated at high density and cultured for 24 h in the presence of 5 mM EDTA displayed an increase in HES1, demonstrating the efficacy of EDTA treatment (Supplementary Fig. S3C). While neither VEGFR1 nor vWF were detected when HBMSCs were plated at low cell density and cultured for 24 h in the absence of EDTA (<xref rid="f0025" ref-type="fig">Figs. 5</xref>A and B, lanes 1), HBMSCs cultured at low cell density in the presence of EDTA expressed both VEGFR1 (<xref rid="f0025" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref>A, lane 2) and vWF (<xref rid="f0025" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref>B, lane 2). Thus, activation of Notch signaling by EDTA exposure induced the expression of EC markers that would otherwise only be expressed by HBMSCs plated at high density.</p>
        <p>To confirm that HBMSCs plated at low density and cultured for 24 h could be induced to up-regulate expression of vWF by Notch activation, HBMSCs at low cell density were exposed to the Notch ligand Jagged-1 (<xref rid="f0025" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref>C). Immunoblot analysis revealed that, compared to unstimulated HBMSCs (<xref rid="f0025" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref>C, lane 1), exposure to Jagged-1 induced HBMSCs at low cell density to enhance vWF expression (<xref rid="f0025" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref>C, lane 2).</p>
        <p>Thus, Notch signaling was sufficient to stimulate EC marker expression in HBMSCs at low cell density.</p>
      </sec>
      <sec id="s0040">
        <title>VEGF-A promoted EC differentiation but inhibited vSMC differentiation</title>
        <p>Since HBMSCs plated at high density for 24 h significantly increased their VEGF-A secretion, which was Notch dependent (<xref rid="f0020" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref>E), experiments were conducted to determine if Notch-induced VEGF-A inhibited differentiation toward vSMCs. When HBMSCs that had been plated at high cell density and cultured for 24 h in the presence of a VEGF neutralisation antibody (designated VEGF-I) (Supplementary Fig. S3D), there was a significant up-regulation of SM-MHC-1 (<xref rid="f0030" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6</xref>A) and desmin expression (data not shown). To confirm that VEGF-A suppressed SM-MHC-1 expression, VEGF siRNA knockdown was performed (Supplementary Figs. S3E and F). VEGF-A knockdown was shown significantly to up-regulate SM-MHC-1 (<xref rid="f0030" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6</xref>B), indicating that VEGF-A was inhibiting expression of this definitive vSMC contractile marker.</p>
        <p>VEGF-A has been implicated in directing HBMSC differentiation toward ECs (see Introduction). However, exposure to exogenous VEGF-A for 24 h did not initiate HBMSC commitment to ECs (Supplementary Figs. S4A–C). To investigate whether, over a longer time frame, VEGF-A influenced HBMSC commitment to ECs, HBMSCs were plated at high density and cultured for 14 days in the absence or presence of VEGF-I, or a chemical inhibitor of VEGF signaling (designated VEGFR-I) (Supplementary Fig. S3G). In the presence of VEGF-I or VEGFR-I, HBMSCs showed a significant reduction in VEGFR1 expression (<xref rid="f0030" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6</xref>C) and VE-cadherin expression (<xref rid="f0030" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6</xref>D). Thus, although VEGF-A is not sufficient to initiate HBMSC differentiation to ECs, it enhances EC differentiation in sustained high cell density cultures.</p>
        <p>To confirm that VEGF-A stimulated VEGFR1 expression over 14 days, HBMSCs plated at high density were exposed to recombinant VEGF-A<sub>.</sub> Following culture of HBMSCs at high density in the presence of VEGF-A, VEGFR1 transcript (<xref rid="f0030" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6</xref>E) and protein expression (<xref rid="f0030" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6</xref>F) were significantly enhanced over this time frame. Thus, Notch-induced VEGF-A supports EC differentiation in sustained high cell density cultures.</p>

        <title>Tubule formation by HBMSCs precultured at high density</title>
        <p>HBMSCs that had been precultured for up to 28 days at high cell density were cultured on Matrigel and exposed to chick chorioallantoic membranes (CAM). Both control and high density cultured HBMSCs readily formed widespread tubule networks on Matrigel, but only high density cultured HBMSCs expressed EC markers (<xref rid="f0035" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7</xref>A).</p>
        <p>While exposure to the CAM induced control HBMSCs to express EC markers (vWF, VE-cadherin, PECAM-1, and VEGFR2), in comparison, HBMSCs cultured at high density produced more abundant EC marker expression, formed more robust tubules (<xref rid="f0035" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7</xref>B), and were found to induce significantly larger blood vessels in the CAM (<xref rid="f0035" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7</xref>C).</p>
        <p>We also evaluated the ability for HBMSCs precultured at high density to retain their EC phenotype when subcultured at low cell density. HBMSCs cultured at high density for 28 days were trypsinised and subcultured at low cell density for 7 days, and then their level of VEGFR1 and vWF expression was determined by immunoblot analysis (Supplementary Fig. S4D). Compared to HBMSCs cultured at high density for 28 days, those subsequently subcultured at low density for 7 days expressed only slightly lower levels of VEGFR1 and vWF, suggesting that the EC phenotype was maintained.</p>
        <p>Together, these data show that coordinated Notch and VEGF-A signals direct the differentiation of HBMSCs toward ECs.</p>

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>Defining the mechanisms that regulate HBMSC differentiation along vascular cell lineages will advance opportunities to exploit them in cell-based and neovascularisation therapies. While HBMSC differentiation toward vSMCs involves mechanical strain (<xref rid="bb0075" ref-type="bibr">Kurpinski et al., 2006</xref>), DNA methylation changes (<xref rid="bb0145" ref-type="bibr">Wakitani et al., 1995</xref>), and TGFβ and Notch signaling (<xref rid="bb0080" ref-type="bibr">Kurpinski et al., 2010</xref>), mechanisms underlying the differentiation of HBMSCs to ECs remain incompletely understood but largely attributed to VEGF-A. In this study, the inductive effect of cell contact has been identified as a potent trigger to vascular differentiation (<xref rid="f0040" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8</xref>). Cell contact-activated Notch signaling initially induced vascular progenitor cells with EC and vSMC characteristics. Subsequent differentiation toward ECs, but not vSMCs, was regulated by Notch-induced VEGF-A. Thus, coordinated Notch and VEGF-A signaling directs HBMSCs toward ECs.</p>
      <p>Notch receptors are critical for vascular development and function (<xref rid="bb0065 bb0085 bb0040 bb0135 bb0070" ref-type="bibr">Gridley, 2007; Lawson et al., 2001; Boulton et al., 2008; Roukens et al., 2010; Jakobsson et al., 2010</xref>). In this study, Notch receptors 1–3 were directly implicated in the induction of vascular progenitor status in the HBMSCs cultured at high density, and thus contribute to vascular commitment. Although Notch 4 can be expressed in vascular cells (<xref rid="bb0155" ref-type="bibr">Wu et al., 2005b</xref>), we did not detect Notch 4 either at 24 h after plating at high density or by 28 days (not shown). Thus, Notch 4 appears not to be necessary for the differentiation of HBMSCs to ECs.</p>
      <p>Density-dependent Notch signaling rapidly induced a vascular progenitor cell state characterised by expression of EC and vSMC markers. Since VEGFR1 is not endothelial-specific, despite being a major EC product (Supplementary Fig. S5), several other endothelial markers were utilized including VEGF-A, VE-cadherin, PECAM-1, and vWF. We found that VEGF-A was strongly induced by Notch, which in turn stimulated commitment of progenitor HBMSCs along the EC lineage. Interestingly, exposure to exogenous VEGF-A at standard density over 24 h was not sufficient to induce HBMSCs to express EC markers (Supplementary Fig. S4). Therefore, VEGF-A is not sufficient to initiate HBMSC differentiation to ECs, although it supports differentiation in sustained high density cultures. <italic>In vivo</italic> studies have documented how VEGF can disrupt vSMC function, ablating pericyte coverage and causing vessel destabilisation (<xref rid="bb0060" ref-type="bibr">Greenberg et al., 2008</xref>). Thus, the Notch-induced VEGF-A may have inhibited HBMSC differentiation to vSMCs while promoting HBMSC differentiation to ECs, and tubule formation.</p>
      <p>We investigated several functional EC features of the high density HBMSCs. Uptake of LDL is a characteristic function of ECs, and here we showed that HBMSCs cultured at high density effectively took up LDL, implying an EC-like state. However, we cannot exclude that the increased LDL uptake might, in part, reflect fat accumulation. When the cells were plated on Matrigel or on CAM membranes, it was clear that they not only produced much larger tubules but also enhanced the expression of several EC markers. Taken together, these data indicate that the high density cells were committed to the EC lineage.</p>
      <p>Our experiments indicate that low density culture suppresses the potential of HBMSCs to differentiate along vascular lineages. Therefore, a double-labeling immunofluorescence approach was used to address whether our HBMSC populations might be bipotential with the ability to differentiate along either SMC or EC lineages. Many cells were found to express both vSMC and EC markers, so it was clear that both lineages can be induced in the same cells over an initial 24 h after plating at high density. However, there may be some heterogeneous potential within our HBMSC populations.</p>
      <p>HBMSCs are known to have therapeutic potential for tissue remodeling and repair. Being multipotent, they can not only differentiate along a range of lineages, they can also enhance tissue repair by secreting anti-inflammatory factors (<xref rid="bb0095" ref-type="bibr">Lee et al., 2009b</xref>). Their culture conditions can affect their phenotypic status; for example, culture in 3D spheres was recently shown to enhance the expression of anti-inflammatory molecules (<xref rid="bb0035" ref-type="bibr">Bartosh et al., 2010</xref>). In this study, we have demonstrated that it is possible to control their vascular differentiation <italic>in vitro</italic>, through regulating plating density and cell–cell contact. High density triggers EC differentiation by rapid induction of Notch signaling which in turn up-regulates VEGF-A, a growth factor that consolidates EC differentiation. These high density <italic>in vitro</italic> conditions may mirror extensive cell contact areas in EC monolayers <italic>in vivo</italic>. Our study, which has defined mechanisms of vascular differentiation of HBMSCs, provides new opportunities to regulate HBMSCs in therapeutic neovascularisation.</p>

            <p>Fig. S1. HBMSC characterisation. (A) Representative phase contrast image of HBMSCs plated at 70% confluence (standard culture), showing characteristic spindle-shaped morphology. Image was obtained using an Olympus (CK X41) microscope (20× objective). Scale bar = 200 μm. (B) Flow cytometry of HBMSCs plated at 70% confluency and cultured for 48 hours. HBMSCs were shown to express characteristic cell surface markers CD73 (ecto 5′ nucleotidase), CD29 (integrin β1 chain), CD44 (hyaluronan receptor), CD105 (endoglin) and CD51 (αV integrin), but did not express the haematopoietic marker (CD34). Red peaks denote PE-conjugated antibodies; green peaks denote FITC conjugated antibodies, while black peaks represent a control IgG<sub>1</sub> antibody. Data are representative of two independent experiments for each analysis. (C) HBMSCs could be induced to differentiate towards adipogenic, osteogenic or chondrogenic lineages. HBMSCs were induced to differentiate towards (I) adipogenic, (II) osteogenic or (III) chondrogenic lineages by using defined differentiation media over 14 days, then analysed by immunofluorescence microscopy. Un-treated HBMSC controls were cultured in basal media over 14 days. Immunofluorescence analysis of (I) adipogenic differentiation showing Bodipy 493/503 (green) and FABP-4 (red), (II) osteogenic differentiation showing osteocalcin (green) and F-actin (red), and (III) chondrogenic differentiation showing aggrecan (green) and F-actin (red). Images were obtained using a Nikon C1 upright confocal microscope (60× objective). Nuclei were stained with DAPI (blue). Scale bars = 20 μm. Representative images are from two independent experiments.</p>

(A-F) Immunofluorescence analysis of Notch receptors 1–3 in HBMSCs cultured at low (HBMSC-L) or high density (HBMSC-H) for 24 hours. Notch receptors (green), DAPI (blue). Images were taken using a Nikon C1 upright microscope (60× objective). Representative images obtained from two independent experiments. (G, H) show IgG<sub>1</sub> negative controls. Scale bars = 20 μm.</p>
            <p>Fig. S3. Notch signaling controls. (A) As a control for DAPT treatment, HES1 transcript levels were determined by RT-PCR, following 50 μM DAPT treatment in HBMSCs cultured at low (L) or high density (H) for 24 hours. GAPDH was used as loading controls. (B) siRNA knockdown of Notch receptors. Immunoblot analysis of Notch receptor 1 (N1), Notch receptor 2 (N2) and Notch receptor 3 (N3) protein expression in HBMSCs cultured for 24 hours at high density, following transfection with 3 μg scrambled (Scr) siRNA as controls (lanes 1, 3 and 5 respectively) or validated target siRNAs for Notch receptors 1, 2 or 3 (lanes 2, 4 and 6 respectively). Membranes were re-probed with an alternative Notch receptor as loading controls and to validate the specificity of each Notch receptor siRNA. (C) As a control for EDTA treatment, HES1 transcript levels were determined by RT-PCR, following 5 mM EDTA treatment in HBMSCs cultured at high density (H) for 24 hours. GAPDH was used as loading controls. VEGFR signaling controls. (D) To verify the efficacy of the VEGF-A neutralisation antibody, HUVECs were either un-treated (Cont), or treated with 1 μg/ml anti-VEGF neutralising antibody (VEGF-I), for 15 min in 0.5% serum DMEM, then stimulated with 50 ng/ml VEGF-A. VEGFR2 was isolated by immunoprecipitation using an anti-VEGFR2 antibody, then tyrosine phosphorylation detected by immunoblot analysis using an anti phosphotyrosine antibody. Membranes were re-probed with an antibody to total VEGFR2 for loading controls. (E-F) To establish the efficiency of VEGF-A knockdown, the level of secreted VEGF-A and the abundance of VEGF-A transcript were determined following knockdown. (E) ELISA assay of VEGF-A derived from medium taken from scrambled siRNA control (Scr ↓) or knockdown VEGF-A transfected HBMSCs, normalised against corresponding β-actin levels. * represents p &lt; 0.05 compared to scrambled control HBMSCs. (F) RNA was isolated from scrambled control (S) or knockdown VEGF-A (V) HBMSCs, then semi-quantitative RT-PCR analysis used to detect GAPDH (lanes 1 and 2) and VEGF-A (lanes 3 and 4) transcript expression. (G) To determine the effectiveness of the chemical inhibitor of VEGF signaling, HUVECs were either un-treated (Cont), or treated with 0.5 μM VEGF receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor (VEGFR-I) for 30 min. VEGFR1 was isolated by immunoprecipitation using an anti-VEGFR1 antibody, and tyrosine phosphorylation was detected by immunoblot analysis using an anti-phosphoVEGFR1 antibody. Membranes were re-probed with an antibody to total VEGFR1 as a loading control.</p>
            <p>Fig. S4. Exposure to recombinant VEGF-A for 24 hours did not induce HBMSCs to express EC markers. (A-C) To determine whether exposure to exogenous VEGF-A alone over 24 hours could induce HBMSCs to express the EC markers (A) PECAM-1, (B) VEGFR1 or (C) VE-cadherin, HBMSCs cultured in standard conditions were stimulated with 50 ng/ml VEGF-A<sub>165</sub> for 24 hours (HBMSC+) (lane 3) or un-stimulated (HBMSC-) (lane 2). HUVECs in standard culture conditions were used as a positive control (lane 1). β-actin was used as loading controls. Representatives of two independent experiments are shown for each analysis. While HUVECs were shown to express PECAM-1 (A; lane 1), VEGFR1 (B; lane 1) and VE-cadherin (C; lane 1), these EC markers could not be detected in HBMSCs cultured in either standard conditions (lane 2), or medium supplemented with 50 ng/ml VEGF-A<sub>165</sub> for 24 hours (lane 3). HBMSCs cultured at high density retained their expression of EC markers when sub-cultured at low density. (D) The ability of HBMSCs cultured at high density to maintain their EC phenotype when sub-cultured at low cell density was evaluated, by determining the expression levels of VEGFR1 and vWF. Immunoblot analysis of VEGFR1 and vWF protein levels in HBMSCs cultured at high density for 28 days (lane 1) or following trypsinisation and sub-culture at low cell density for 7 days (lane 2). A representative of two independent experiments is shown.</p>
            <p>Fig. S5. HBMSCs plated at high cell density induced expression of VEGFR1, vWF and VE-cadherin. (A) VEGFR expression was examined by semi-quantitative RT-PCR analysis. HUVECs plated at standard cell density, and HBMSCs at low density (HBMSC-L) or high cell density (HBMSC-H), were cultured for 14 days, then semi-quantitative RT-PCR analysis used to detect VEGFR1 (99-bp) (lane 1); VEGFR2 (81-bp); (lane 2) and VEGFR3 (87-bp) (lane3) transcript expression. Two different primer pairs for VEGFRs 1–3 gave similar results, and GAPDH (71-bp) was used as a loading control. While all three VEGFR transcripts were expressed by HUVECs, no VEGFR transcripts were detected in HBMSCs cultured at low density, but VEGFR1 was expressed by HBMSCs cultured at high density. (B) VE-cadherin expression was examined by semi-quantitative RT-PCR analysis. HUVECs (HUV) plated at standard cell density and HBMSCs at low density (HBMSC-L) were cultured for 7 days, while HBMSCs at high cell density (HBMSC-H) were cultured for 28 days, then semi-quantitative RT-PCR analysis used to detect VE-cadherin (74-bp) (lanes 1-4) transcript expression. GAPDH (71-bp) was used as a loading control. Both HUVECs (lane 1) and HBMSCs at high density (lanes 2 and 3) were shown to express VE-cadherin, but no VE-cadherin transcript was detected in HBMSCs cultured at low density (lane 4). (C-D) Quantitative PCR (qPCR) analysis of VEGFR1 and vWF transcript levels in HBMSCs cultured at low or high density. HBMSCs were plated at low density (HBMSC-L) or high density (HBMSC-H) and cultured for 14 days, then qPCR analysis used to determine the levels of VEGFR1 and vWF transcripts. Each sample was run in triplicate. * represents p&lt;0.05 compared to HBMSCs culture at low density. Data were normalized to GAPDH, and relative expression was calculated according to the 2-[Delta]CT formula. Compared to low density HBMSC culture, the levels of both VEGFR1 and vWF transcripts were significantly increased by culture at high density.</p>
