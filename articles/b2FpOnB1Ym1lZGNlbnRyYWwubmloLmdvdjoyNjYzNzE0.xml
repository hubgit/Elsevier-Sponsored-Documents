        <title>Summary</title>
        <p>Protecting against both liver and blood stages of infection is a long-sought goal of malaria vaccine design. Recently, we described the use of replication-defective viral vaccine vectors expressing the malaria antigen merozoite surface protein-1 (MSP-1) as an antimalarial vaccine strategy that elicits potent and protective antibody responses against blood-stage parasites. Here, we show that vaccine-induced MSP-1-specific CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells provide essential help for protective B cell responses, and CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells mediate significant antiparasitic activity against liver-stage parasites. Enhanced survival is subsequently seen in immunized mice following challenge with sporozoites, which mimics the natural route of infection more closely than when using infected red blood cells. This effect is evident both in the presence and absence of protective antibodies and is associated with decreased parasite burden in the liver followed by enhanced induction of the cytokine IFN-γ in the serum. Multistage immunity against malaria can thus be achieved by using viral vectors recombinant for MSP-1.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>Approximately 500 million cases and 1 million deaths occur annually due to <italic>Plasmodium falciparum</italic> malaria infection (<xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">Greenwood et al., 2008</xref>). The development of an effective vaccine remains an important goal for the safe and cost-effective control of this disease. Blood-stage malaria vaccine development has classically focused on recombinant protein-in-adjuvant formulations (<xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">Genton and Reed, 2007</xref>); however, we have described the use of replication-defective viral vaccine vectors expressing the malaria antigen merozoite surface protein-1 (MSP-1) as a promising alternative vaccination strategy (<xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">Draper et al., 2008</xref>).</p>
      <p>MSP-1 is a large polypeptide that undergoes proteolytic processing upon erythrocyte invasion, during which the 42 kDa C terminus (MSP-1<sub>42</sub>) is cleaved into 33 kDa (MSP-1<sub>33</sub>) and 19 kDa (MSP-1<sub>19</sub>) fragments (<xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr">Holder et al., 1987</xref>). High-titer antibody responses against MSP-1<sub>19</sub>, but not MSP-1<sub>33</sub>, are reported to account for the protective immunity induced by this antigen (<xref rid="bib1 bib33" ref-type="bibr">Ahlborg et al., 2002; Yuen et al., 2007</xref>). Previously, we have demonstrated that a priming immunization with adenovirus human serotype 5 (AdHu5) followed by a boost with modified vaccinia virus Ankara (MVA), both recombinant for <italic>P. yoelii</italic> MSP-1<sub>42</sub>, can induce potent antibody responses that protect against a lethal challenge with blood-stage parasites.</p>
      <p>Viral vaccine vectors, deployed in heterologous prime-boost regimes, have been routinely developed to induce strong T cell responses targeting intracellular pathogens (<xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr">Hill, 2006</xref>), and as expected, the AdHu5-MVA-MSP-1 regime also induced potent MSP-1-specific T cell responses in mice (<xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">Draper et al., 2008</xref>). However, we demonstrated that depletion of T cell responses in mice prior to blood-stage challenge did not ablate vaccine efficacy, despite the fact that CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell lines that recognize epitopes within MSP-1<sub>33</sub> are reported to control the growth of <italic>P. yoelii</italic> following adoptive transfer into immunodeficient mice (<xref rid="bib31" ref-type="bibr">Wipasa et al., 2002</xref>). Nevertheless, MSP-1 is reported to be expressed within the exoerythrocytic schizonts (<xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr">Sacci et al., 2005</xref>), and T cells against <italic>P. yoelii</italic> MSP-1 have been reported to protect against the liver-stage parasite using a heat shock protein fusion construct (<xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr">Kawabata et al., 2002</xref>). We therefore sought to investigate whether the induction of cellular immune responses, in conjunction with antibody responses, could enhance vaccine efficacy by targeting the parasite at both the liver and blood stages of malaria infection.</p>
      <p>Here, we describe in detail the immune mechanisms elicited in mice immunized with AdHu5-MVA-MSP-1 vaccines. We show that CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell responses against MSP-1<sub>33</sub> provide essential help for priming B cell responses against MSP-1<sub>19</sub>, while CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell responses against MSP-1<sub>33</sub> mediate significant antiparasitic activity against the liver stage. In agreement with protein vaccine studies (<xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr">Ahlborg et al., 2002</xref>), MSP-1<sub>33</sub>-specific responses alone do not mediate blood-stage protection following challenge infection with parasitized red blood cells (pRBCs). However, the AdHu5-MVA-MSP-1 vaccine regimes demonstrate consistently better protection against a lethal blood-stage infection following challenge with <italic>P. yoelii</italic> sporozoites, rather than inoculation with pRBCs. Enhanced efficacy following sporozoite (spz) challenge is associated with vaccine-induced effector mechanisms acting against the liver and blood stages of infection. These data demonstrate that multistage immunity against malaria can be achieved using a single vaccine platform that induces both strong antibody and T cell responses against the MSP-1 antigen.</p>

        <title>Immunogenicity of AdHu5-MVA-MSP-1 Recombinants</title>
        <p>The immunogenicity of heterologous prime-boost immunization using AdHu5 and MVA vectors expressing MSP-1<sub>42</sub> has been previously reported (<xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">Draper et al., 2008</xref>), however, we sought to address the contribution of the MSP-1<sub>33</sub> and MSP-1<sub>19</sub> component domains of MSP-1<sub>42</sub> to immunogenicity.</p>
        <p>Mice were immunized as described in <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref> using AdHu5-MVA vectors expressing the MSP-1<sub>42</sub>, MSP-1<sub>33</sub>, or MSP-1<sub>19</sub> antigen (AdM42, AdM33, or AdM19, respectively), and antigen-specific immune responses were assayed. Relatively weak CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell responses could be detected in the spleens of AdM42- and AdM33-immunized mice by intracellular cytokine staining (ICS) using a pool of overlapping peptides to MSP-1<sub>33</sub> (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>A). These CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells almost exclusively produced only IFN-γ. In contrast, multifunctional CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell responses to MSP-1<sub>33</sub> were detected. These populations of T cells secreted various combinations of IFN-γ, TNF-α, and IL-2 and were of similar magnitude in mice immunized with AdM42 and AdM33 (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>B). A clear hierarchy was also evident with a dominant population composed of IFN-γ<sup>+</sup> TNF-α<sup>+</sup> “double-positive” cells, followed by a population that produced only IFN-γ, and finally, a small population that was “triple-positive” and secreted all three cytokines, indicating only low-level production of IL-2 in comparison to IFN-γ and TNF-α. No regime induced MSP-1<sub>19</sub>-specific T cell responses that could be detected by ICS (data not shown). As previously reported, mice immunized with the AdM42 regime developed strong total IgG responses against the entire antigen, while in comparison, mice immunized with AdM33 developed a significantly higher total IgG response against MSP-1<sub>33</sub> (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>C). Interestingly, in contrast to mice immunized with AdM42, those immunized with AdM19 developed no detectable antibody response to MSP-1<sub>19</sub> (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>C). However, antibody responses in mice that were primed with Ad42 could be boosted by MVA expressing MSP-1<sub>19</sub> (Ad42M19 regime; <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>D). These data indicate that essential T cell help for priming naive B cell responses against MSP-1<sub>19</sub> comes from T cells induced against MSP-1<sub>33</sub>, but that there exists a different, and possibly reduced, requirement for CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell help for memory B cells activated by a secondary exposure to the MSP-1<sub>19</sub> antigen.</p>

      <sec id="sec2.2">
        <title>Efficacy of AdHu5-MVA Recombinants against pRBC Challenge</title>
        <p>We have reported that AdM42 immunization can protect 76% of BALB/c mice (13 of 17) against a lethal challenge with 10<sup>4</sup> <italic>P. yoelii</italic> pRBCs (<xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">Draper et al., 2008</xref>). That study did not confirm whether antibodies against MSP-1<sub>33</sub> played a role in blood-stage immunity. Here, we assessed the protective efficacy of AdM33 and AdM19 immunization against a blood-stage challenge (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>A). None of the mice immunized with AdM33 survived challenge, despite higher total IgG responses and similar T cell responses against MSP-1<sub>33</sub> as compared to mice immunized with AdM42 (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>). This confirms that no protection is mediated in this pRBC challenge model by MSP-1<sub>33</sub>-specific immune responses alone. Survival was seen in four of six mice (67%) immunized with Ad42M19, and notably, these mice possessed only high-titer IgG responses to MSP-1<sub>19</sub> (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>D). In contrast, none of the mice immunized with AdM19 was protected, which was unsurprising, given the absence of detectable immune responses induced by this vaccine regime (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>). In agreement with our previous report, protection in this pRBC challenge model is dependent on MSP-1<sub>19</sub>-specific IgG.</p>
      </sec>
      <sec id="sec2.3">
        <title>Efficacy of AdHu5-MVA Recombinants against Sporozoite Challenge</title>
        <p>Malaria challenge with pRBCs does not mimic the natural mode of malaria infection by sporozoites. The efficacy of AdHu5-MVA-MSP-1 immunization against spz challenge was thus investigated (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>B). After a lag period corresponding to the pre-erythrocytic infection, naive control mice succumbed to infection in an identical manner to those challenged with pRBCs and with near-identical parasitemia profiles (<xref rid="app2" ref-type="sec">Figure S2</xref>A), suggesting that parasite virulence between the two challenge models is comparable. Nevertheless, all of the mice immunized with AdM42 developed patent blood-stage parasitemia (<xref rid="app2" ref-type="sec">Figure S2</xref>B) but were able to control blood-stage parasite growth and clear the infection (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>B). Indeed, following spz rather than pRBC challenge, blood-stage protection (using percent survival as the outcome measure) showed a significant increase, from 76% (<xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">Draper et al., 2008</xref>) to 100%, in mice immunized with AdM42, p = 0.046. Survival was also enhanced by a similar margin, to 25%, in mice immunized with AdM33 following spz challenge (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figures 2</xref>B and <xref rid="app2" ref-type="sec">S2</xref>A), as compared to 0% in naive controls following spz challenge (p = 0.044) or 0% in mice immunized with AdM33 following pRBC challenge (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>A). None of the mice immunized with AdM19 survived spz challenge.</p>
        <p>We postulated that a number of factors could potentially contribute to an increase in vaccine efficacy following spz rather than pRBC challenge. These factors, in concert with MSP-1<sub>19</sub>-specific IgG, may enhance blood-stage protection mediated by AdM42 immunization, or in a small number of cases, lead to survival against blood-stage infection in mice immunized with AdM33 that lack protective antibodies. Indeed, we had consistently noted a significant reduction in blood-stage parasitemia in mice immunized with AdM33 on day 5 after spz challenge (∼48 hr after merozoite release from the liver), but not 48 hr after direct blood-stage infection by pRBC challenge (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>C). We therefore sought to investigate a possible antiparasitic effect induced by AdM42 and AdM33 immunization against the liver-stage parasite.</p>

        <title>MSP-1<sub>33</sub>-Specific CD8<sup>+</sup> T Cell Responses Mediate Partial Efficacy against the Liver-Stage Parasite</title>
        <p>The exoerythrocytic cycle of <italic>P. yoelii</italic> lasts approximately 50 hr (<xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr">Killick-Kendrick and Peters, 1978</xref>). Given that AdM42 and AdM33 immunization elicits strong CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell responses against MSP-1<sub>33</sub> (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>B), it is possible that these effector T cells can protect against the late exoerythrocytic schizonts that contain merozoites expressing MSP-1. To address this question, mice were immunized with AdM42 or with the previously described vaccines expressing MSP-1<sub>42</sub> fused to mouse complement C4b-binding protein (C4bp) (<xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">Draper et al., 2008</xref>) and were challenged with 5000 sporozoites, and the liver-stage parasite burden was quantified using a real-time RT-PCR assay (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>A). Mice immunized with both regimes showed a significant reduction in comparison to naive controls. These data are in agreement with challenge studies using 50 sporozoites, whereby the observed partial reduction in liver-stage parasite burden would not result in sterile immunity and hence not prevent blood-stage infection (<xref rid="app2" ref-type="sec">Figures S2</xref>B and S2C). To confirm the role of T cells in mediating liver-stage immunity, mice were immunized with AdM42-C4bp and then depleted of T cells prior to spz challenge. Depletion of CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells and, to a lesser extent, CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells attenuated the vaccine-induced reduction in liver-stage parasite burden (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>B).</p>
        <p>Given that the CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell response elicited by the AdM42 vaccine regime in BALB/c mice is targeted against epitopes within MSP-1<sub>33</sub> (<xref rid="bib26" ref-type="bibr">Sridhar et al., 2008</xref>), and given that the AdM33 regime described here induces a similar T cell response to AdM42 (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>), we sought to confirm that this vaccine could mediate similar efficacy against the liver-stage forms of <italic>P. yoelii</italic>. BALB/c mice were immunized with AdM33 or vector controls (AdM-GFP). A significant reduction in liver-stage parasite burden was observed with AdM33 (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>C), similar to that previously seen with AdM42. The reduced liver-stage burden with AdM33 was reflected in the levels of blood-stage parasitemia on day 5 following challenge with 50 sporozoites (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>D). In vivo depletion of the CD8<sup>+</sup> and CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell subsets again confirmed that this protective effect is primarily dependent on CD8<sup>+</sup> and not on CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells, as noted by a loss of this reduction in blood-stage parasitemia on day 5 (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>E). Partial efficacy against the liver-stage parasite in this model can thus be attributed to the T cell response against the MSP-1<sub>33</sub> antigen when used alone or in the context of MSP-1<sub>42</sub>.</p>

      <sec id="sec2.5">
        <title>Viral Vector Immunization Mediates Short-Term Efficacy against Sporozoite Challenge</title>
        <p>During these spz challenge experiments (conducted 14 days after boosting), we noted a small and consistent but not statistically significant reduction in blood-stage parasitemia on day 5 postchallenge in mice immunized with AdM19 and AdM-GFP (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>D). This effect was not apparent following challenge at a later time point (data not shown). It has been reported that potent Th1-type innate immune responses induced by CpG immunization can mediate short-term protection against <italic>P. yoelii</italic> spz challenge, which is dependent on IFN-γ and IL-12 and, in some cases, also NK cells, nitric oxide, and CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells (<xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr">Gramzinski et al., 2001</xref>). We tested the possibility that this may also be the case for viral vectored vaccines, whereby short-term protection can be mediated against spz challenge by vector control vaccines. Mice were primed with Ad-GFP and boosted with MVA-GFP 8 weeks later or simply primed with MVA-GFP alone. Mice were then challenged 2, 4, or 14 days later with 50 sporozoites. Eighty-three percent of the mice challenged on day 2 or day 4 were protected against challenge and did not develop blood-stage parasitemia (<xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). This protective effect was the same following either a single immunization with MVA-GFP or AdM-GFP prime-boost, indicating a strong immune response against the MVA vector, rather than a strong boosting of the immune response against that of the GFP transgene, is accounting for protection (immune responses against GFP have been documented in BALB/c mice [<xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">Gambotto et al., 2000</xref>]). In vivo depletion studies suggested this protective effect is mediated by CD8<sup>+</sup> and CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells and NK cells, but not by macrophages (<xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>).</p>

      <sec id="sec2.6">
        <title>AdM42 Immunization Protects Mice against a High-Dose Sporozoite Challenge</title>
        <p>Having established that AdM42 and AdM33 immunization can mediate an antiparasitic effect at the liver stage, we sought to assess whether the increased survival outcome against spz challenge was due to a reduction in the blood-stage inoculum from the liver. A single hepatic schizont of <italic>P. yoelii</italic> malaria will produce approximately 7500–8000 merozoites (<xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr">Killick-Kendrick and Peters, 1978</xref>). Consequently, just two infected hepatocytes should release a larger blood-stage inoculum than the 10<sup>4</sup> pRBCs used in the blood-stage challenge model. Levels of blood-stage parasitemia were compared 2 days post blood-stage infection in naive BALB/c mice challenged with 10<sup>4</sup> pRBCs, 50 sporozoites (low dose), or 250 sporozoites (high dose) (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>A). These data showed that spz challenge in naive mice leads to a significantly higher blood-stage parasitemia after 48 hr of blood-stage infection when compared to pRBC challenge. Mice immunized with AdM33 have a reduced liver-stage parasite burden (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>C) but do not possess protective IgG. The same assessment of blood-stage parasitemia in mice immunized with AdM33 and challenged with 50 sporozoites showed, interestingly, that the mean parasitemia level was significantly reduced to one comparable with pRBC challenge (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>A). These data indicate that if the amount of blood-stage inoculum from the liver was the sole determinant of survival outcome, then mice immunized with AdM33 and challenged with 10<sup>4</sup> pRBCs or 50 sporozoites should show the same percent survival outcome, which was not the case (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figures 2</xref>A and 2B).</p>
        <p>Vaccines developed against <italic>P. yoelii</italic> can show reduced efficacy against a high-dose challenge with 250 sporozoites (<xref rid="bib25" ref-type="bibr">Sedegah et al., 2002</xref>). To confirm that protective efficacy was maintained at a higher blood-stage inoculum, mice were immunized with AdM42 and challenged with 250 sporozoites. All of the immunized mice (12 of 12) survived this higher dose challenge, compared to 0 of 8 naive control mice. Complete survival is thus maintained even after a high-dose <italic>P. yoelii</italic> spz challenge.</p>

To confirm that parasites do not have defective blood-stage growth following an effective liver-stage immune response, mice were immunized with AdM33 or given a single immunization of 1 × 10<sup>8</sup> viral particles (vp) AdHu5-PyCSP and then challenged with 50 sporozoites. This dose of AdHu5-PyCSP vaccine was titered to give a similar reduction in liver-stage parasite burden as AdM33 but not sterilizing immunity.

        <p>We hypothesized that an alternative explanation for the observed increase in survival may be due to an enhanced de novo production of protective anti-MSP-1<sub>19</sub> IgG responses in mice previously immunized with AdM33. In this scenario, CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell helper responses would be primed and ready to assist naive B cells immediately upon natural exposure to MSP-1<sub>19</sub> antigen. Serum antibody responses were measured in all mice prechallenge and ∼120 hr post blood-stage infection. Indeed, following spz challenge, 7 of 12 of the mice immunized with AdM33 had developed detectable IgG responses against MSP-1<sub>19</sub> within 5 days (<xref rid="app2" ref-type="sec">Figure S3</xref>). Only two other mice within all of the other vaccinated or control groups possessed a detectable IgG antibody response against this domain. However, the levels of these detected antibodies were far below the protective threshold established in previous work (<xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">Draper et al., 2008</xref>), and furthermore, a similar number (5 of 11) of mice immunized with AdM33 and challenged with pRBCs also developed detectable MSP-1<sub>19</sub> IgG responses, but did not survive. So these weak antibody responses by themselves are highly unlikely to account for protective efficacy at this time point.</p>

        <title>Viral-Vector Immunization Enhances the IFN-γ Serum Cytokine Response against Blood-Stage Parasites Following Sporozoite but Not pRBC Challenge</title>
        <p>A balanced cytokine response is reported to be essential for the control of blood-stage parasite growth. The ratio of protective proinflammatory cytokines (such as IFN-γ and TNF-α) to regulatory cytokines (such as IL-10 and TGF-β), has been shown to determine the outcome of natural blood-stage infection with lethal versus nonlethal <italic>P. yoelii</italic> (<xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr">Omer et al., 2003</xref>) and to correlate with the growth rate of blood-stage parasites in malaria-naive human volunteers (<xref rid="bib29" ref-type="bibr">Walther et al., 2006</xref>). We hypothesized that exposure of vaccine-induced T cells to MSP-1 at the liver stage (after spz challenge) might allow for the development of a qualitatively or quantitatively different and more protective cytokine response than is developed in mice challenged only with pRBCs, who will not have had this antecedent activation of T cells prior to blood-stage infection. Mice were thus immunized and then challenged with pRBCs or sporozoites. Blood samples were taken prechallenge and 2 days and 5 days after the onset of blood-stage infection, and serum cytokines were assessed using a cytometric bead array assay. Mice that were immunized with AdM33 and not challenged (“AdM33 control”) showed no detectable serum cytokine responses at any time point (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figures 5</xref>A, 5C, and 5E). Naive mice challenged with pRBCs or sporozoites showed a similar induction of IFN-γ, TNF-α, and IL-10 in the serum by 120 hr post blood-stage infection (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figures 5</xref>A–5F). Yet mice that were immunized with AdM33 and then challenged with pRBCs showed a significant early induction of IFN-γ after 48 hr, which was then significantly downregulated by 120 hr, when compared to naive controls (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref>A). The level of IL-10 in the serum mirrored this trend at the 120 hr time point in immunized mice and was significantly lower than in the naive controls (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref>C). However, this was not the case in mice immunized with AdM33 and challenged with sporozoites. Their mean serum levels of IFN-γ and IL-10 were similar to naive controls after 48 hr (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figures 5</xref>B and 5D), and IFN-γ was not downregulated by 120 hr (as it was for pRBC-challenged mice) but was in fact significantly higher (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref>B). In the case of mice immunized with AdM19, AdM-GFP, or Ad-PyCSP, a similar trend was maintained, but none of these groups possessed significantly higher levels of IFN-γ in the serum as compared to naive controls at this time point (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figures 5</xref>B and <xref rid="app2" ref-type="sec">S4</xref>). Serum levels of TNF-α were similar in all the challenge groups (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figures 5</xref>E and 5F). These data indicate that the increased survival in mice immunized with AdM33 and then challenged with spz rather than pRBCs is associated with a more effective and maintained induction of IFN-γ—a pattern similar to that seen in the nonlethal 17XNL strain of <italic>P. yoelii</italic> and contrasting with the lethal 17XL parasite strain (<xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr">Omer et al., 2003</xref>).</p>

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>We report a vaccination strategy that can induce protective multistage immunity against malaria by using viral vectors that are suitable for human use (<xref rid="bib4 bib12" ref-type="bibr">Catanzaro et al., 2006; Hill, 2006</xref>). These viral vaccines expressing MSP-1<sub>42</sub>, like protein vaccines, allow for the induction of highly protective IgG against MSP-1<sub>19</sub>, which accounts for the major protective mechanism in this model against the blood-stage parasite. However, unlike protein vaccines, the concomitant induction of MSP-1<sub>33</sub>-specific T cells and, to a lesser extent, antigen-nonspecific vector-induced responses can provide partial liver-stage efficacy in this mouse model and should allow for combination with similar partially effective pre-erythrocytic antigen vectors (<xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr">Hill, 2006</xref>). Following spz challenge of immunized mice, the significantly reduced blood-stage inoculum is associated with a maintained induction of IFN-γ in the blood. This in turn correlates with increased survival in mice immunized against MSP-1<sub>33</sub> or complete survival in mice immunized with MSP-1<sub>42</sub> (and which also possess protective IgG against MSP-1<sub>19</sub>). These data have important implications for the choice of clinical challenge model used to assess new candidate blood-stage malaria vaccines and demonstrate that the induction of effective immune responses against both the liver and blood stages of malaria infection can lead to increased vaccine efficacy.</p>
      <p>The need for CD4<sup>+</sup> T helper cell responses against MSP-1<sub>33</sub> to prime antibody responses against MSP-1<sub>19</sub> is in agreement with studies that show MSP-1<sub>19</sub> is refractory to antigen processing (<xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr">Hensmann et al., 2004</xref>). Similarly, following immunization of naive humans with an MSP-1<sub>42</sub> formulation in a phase I clinical trial, T cell responses were identified against MSP-1<sub>33</sub> and not MSP-1<sub>19</sub> (<xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr">Huaman et al., 2008</xref>). The ability of the vectors expressing MSP-1<sub>19</sub> to boost but not prime these antibody responses would support the use of MSP-1<sub>19</sub> recombinant protein vaccines to boost antibody responses primed by viral vectors expressing MSP-1<sub>42</sub>.</p>
      <p>CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell responses were detected only against MSP-1<sub>33</sub>, and their ability to mediate liver-stage protection is consistent with the expression of MSP-1 during liver-stage infection (<xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr">Sacci et al., 2005</xref>) and a previous MSP-1 study that demonstrated comparable liver-stage efficacy (<xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr">Kawabata et al., 2002</xref>) using a T cell-inducing vaccine technology that required intravenous vaccine administration. The inability of MSP-1<sub>33</sub>-specific T cells and IgG to protect against a pRBC challenge is in agreement with some (<xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr">Ahlborg et al., 2002</xref>) but not all (<xref rid="bib31" ref-type="bibr">Wipasa et al., 2002</xref>) previous studies. Taken together, these data argue for the use of MSP-1<sub>42</sub>- rather than MSP-1<sub>19</sub>-based vaccines to increase the likelihood of inducing multistage protection.</p>
      <p>Antimalarial factors that can reduce liver-stage burden, including bednets (<xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr">Lengeler, 2004</xref>), immunogenetic risk factors (<xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr">Hill et al., 1991</xref>), and the RTS,S/AS02 vaccine (<xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr">Alonso et al., 2004</xref>), can ameliorate the severity of subsequent blood-stage infection in naturally exposed individuals. However, this effect has not been reported in the literature for preclinical studies of pre-erythrocytic-stage vaccine candidates. In our report, enhanced survival following spz challenge appears to be due to vaccine-induced effector mechanisms acting against both the liver and blood stages of infection. Immunization with AdM42 or AdM33 leads to a reduced merozoite load emerging from the liver, which is then associated with a more effective induction of protective IFN-γ early after blood-stage infection. This is in comparison to pRBC challenge where this cytokine appears to be induced faster but then downregulated. Although blood-stage parasites have been reported to modulate immune cell function (<xref rid="bib28 bib30 bib32" ref-type="bibr">Urban et al., 1999; Wipasa et al., 2001; Wykes et al., 2005</xref>), why cytokine induction should be different following inoculation of the blood via sporozoites or pRBCs remains unknown.</p>
      <p>In one study using <italic>P. chabaudi</italic> parasites, differences in the cytokine responses of CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells were noted after the infection of naive mice with pRBCs versus mosquito bite (<xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">Fonseca et al., 2007</xref>). In this model, Th1 cytokine responses were in fact reduced following infection by the route of natural transmission. In our model, however, antigen-specific responses have been primed by vaccination, and so temporal activation of MSP-1-specific T cell populations, innate effector cell types, or antigen-presenting cells in the liver prior to blood-stage infection may be an important factor in determining outcome. It should be noted that this effect occurred significantly only in mice immunized with AdM33, and not those immunized with Ad-PyCSP. The activation of antigen-specific T cells during liver infection may only influence the blood-stage infection if antigen expression is maintained by the parasite in the blood stage, explaining why significantly increased serum levels of IFN-γ were found in mice immunized against MSP-1 but not CSP. Our data did not indicate that, following a partially effective T cell response in the liver, the remaining parasites were damaged or less virulent in the blood stage. Similarly, an earlier induction of protective antibody responses against MSP-1<sub>19</sub> did occur in mice possessing CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells primed against MSP-1<sub>33</sub> before challenge; however, these were not universal and could not alone count for the differences in survival observed between the two challenge models.</p>
      <p>The assessment of blood-stage malaria vaccine efficacy in phase I/IIa clinical trials can use one of two models. The spz clinical challenge model allows for an assessment of complete or partial protection at the liver stage in immunized volunteers, and although blood-film positivity requires drug cure, partial blood-stage efficacy can be observed prior to this in partially protected volunteers by using real-time PCR (<xref rid="bib27" ref-type="bibr">Thompson et al., 2008</xref>). An alternative blood-stage parasite clinical challenge model uses a smaller blood-stage inoculum (compared to spz challenge), which leads to a longer prepatent period and more time for assessment of blood-stage parasite growth rates by real-time PCR (<xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr">Sanderson et al., 2008</xref>) but to date has only been utilized in three clinical studies (<xref rid="bib18 bib21 bib24" ref-type="bibr">Lawrence et al., 2000; Pombo et al., 2002; Sanderson et al., 2008</xref>). With many promising new blood-stage vaccine candidates entering the clinical phase, careful consideration needs to be given to the choice of challenge model employed to assess efficacy prior to field studies, including which effector mechanisms may contribute to protective immunity and whether these may also be effective against the liver stage.</p>
      <p>The concept of inducing multistage protection has been a holy grail of malaria vaccine design, and many attempts to do this have been reported. Here, we report that a single antigen can induce significant protective efficacy at the pre-erythrocytic and erythrocytic stages of infection and following only two immunizations. This reflects, in part, the unusual ability of this vectored vaccine regime to induce both high titers of antibody and strong T cell responses. These data encourage the development of vaccine technologies that can induce strong antibody and T cell responses against multistage malaria antigens in order to achieve maximal protective efficacy.</p>

Fourteen days after boost, splenocytes were restimulated with MSP-1<sub>33</sub> peptides, and the production of IFN-γ, TNF-α, and IL-2 by CD4+ (A) and CD8+ (B) T cells in the spleen was assessed using polychromatic flow cytometry. The functional compositions of the CD4<sup>+</sup> and CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell responses are shown, and these are grouped and color-coded according to the vaccine regime and number of cytokines secreted by each T cell population. The pie charts in (B) summarize the fractions of MSP-1<sub>33</sub>-specific CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells that are positive for a given number of functions. Individual data points and mean percentage of the total response (open bars) are shown for each of the functional populations indicated on the x axis. No responses were detected above background following restimulation with MSP-1<sub>19</sub> peptides (data not shown). Representative flow cytometry plots and the gating strategy are shown in <xref rid="app2" ref-type="sec">Figure S1</xref>.</p>
        <p>(C and D) Total IgG serum antibody responses against MSP-1<sub>19</sub> and MSP-1<sub>33</sub> were measured by ELISA in mice primed and boosted as indicated. Mean responses ± SEM are shown (n = six mice per group). N.D. = not detected. <sup>∗</sup> p ≤ 0.05 in (C) (independent Student's t test comparing responses between the AdM42 and AdM33 groups).
