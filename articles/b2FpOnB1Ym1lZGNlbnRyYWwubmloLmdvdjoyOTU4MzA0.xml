        <title>Summary</title>
        <p>The <italic>Drosophila</italic> genes <italic>fat</italic> (<italic>ft</italic>) and <italic>dachsous</italic> (<italic>ds</italic>) encode large atypical cadherins that collaborate to coordinately polarize cells in the plane of the epithelium (planar cell polarity) and to affect growth via the Warts/Hippo pathway [<xref rid="bib1 bib2 bib3" ref-type="bibr">1–3</xref>]. Ft and Ds form heterodimeric bridges that convey polarity information from cell to cell [<xref rid="bib4 bib5 bib6 bib7" ref-type="bibr">4–7</xref>]. <italic>four-jointed</italic> (<italic>fj</italic>) is a modulator of Ft/Ds activity that acts in a graded fashion in the abdomen, eye, and wing [<xref rid="bib8 bib9 bib10 bib11" ref-type="bibr">8–11</xref>]. Genetic evidence indicates that Fj acts via Ds and/or Ft [<xref rid="bib4 bib6 bib7 bib8 bib9 bib12" ref-type="bibr">4, 6–9, 12</xref>], and here we demonstrate that Fj can act independently on Ds and on Ft. It has been reported that Fj has kinase activity and can phosphorylate a subset of cadherin domains of both Ft and Ds in vitro [<xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. We have used both cell and in vitro assays to measure binding between Ft and Ds. We find that phosphorylation of Ds reduces its affinity for Ft in both of these assays. By expressing forms of Ds that lack the defined phosphorylation sites or have phosphomimetic amino acids at these positions, we demonstrate that effects of Fj on wing size and planar polarity can be explained by Fj phosphorylating these sites.</p>

        <title>Genetic Data Indicate that Fj Can Act on Ds and Ft In Vivo</title>
        <p>If the levels of Ft, Ds, or Fj are altered in clonal patches of cells, the normal (genetically wild-type) cells nearby have their polarity changed so that, in some cases, all hairs point in toward the clones or, in other cases, outward away from them. Extensive use of this experimental assay has given insight into how these three molecules act to build planar polarity [<xref rid="bib6 bib7 bib8 bib9 bib14 bib15 bib16" ref-type="bibr">6–9, 14–16</xref>], but it has not been clear whether Fj acts on Ds, on Ft, or on both molecules. We therefore made clones that lacked endogenous Ft and Ds but also overexpressed <italic>ectoDs</italic> (<italic>UAS.ectoDs</italic>), an active form of Ds lacking the intracellular domain [<xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. These clones reversed the polarity of hairs behind the clone (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>A), but coexpression of <italic>UAS.fj</italic> with <italic>UAS.ectoDs</italic> largely suppressed this repolarization (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>B). Here, because no Ft was present in the clones, Fj must have inhibited Ds and could not have acted via Ft. Overexpression of <italic>ft</italic> (<italic>UAS.ft</italic>), in the absence of endogenous Ds and Ft, caused a repolarization of hairs so that they pointed away from the clone (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>C), and in this case coexpression of <italic>UAS.fj</italic> increased the range of repolarization (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>D). Therefore, because no Ds was present, Fj must have been acting on Ft itself to promote its activity. Both <italic>ds<sup>−</sup> ft</italic><sup>−</sup> and <italic>ds<sup>−</sup> ft<sup>−</sup> UAS.fj</italic> clones do not repolarize the surrounding wild-type hairs [<xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>], arguing that Fj acts by changing the activity of Ds and Ft inside the clones—and not by acting (for example, as a secreted protein) directly on Ds and/or Ft in neighboring wild-type cells. Modification of Ft or Ds inside the clone then presumably alters the strength of Ft-Ds heterophilic interactions across the clone boundary, leading to a change in the range of repolarization around the clone. These experiments demonstrate that Fj can modulate the activity of both Ft and Ds in vivo.</p>

        <title>Point Mutations in Fj Abrogate the Ability to Phosphorylate Ft and Ds</title>
        <p>All Fj proteins have a highly conserved region located at the C terminus of the protein (see <xref rid="app2" ref-type="sec">Figure S1</xref>A available online); in the <italic>Drosophila</italic> Fj protein, this domain comprises amino acids 432 to 508. The region shows homology to a kinase-active site [<xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] containing the essential aspartate residues required for kinase function, as well as other conserved residues nearby. Ishikawa et al. [<xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] mutated amino acids 490–492 of Fj, which includes the putative Mn<sup>2+</sup>-binding site (D490), and found that this protein could no longer phosphorylate Ft or Ds cadherin domains and was nonfunctional in vivo. We mutated three conserved aspartic acid residues to glutamine at the putative active site (D454Q), the putative Mn<sup>2+</sup>-binding site (D490Q), and at a more N-terminal position (D447Q) within the domain. Mutation of any one of these three sites abolished the protein's ability to phosphorylate Ft and Ds cadherin domains in D.mel2 cells (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figures 1</xref>J and 1K; <xref rid="app2" ref-type="sec">Figure S1</xref>B), but these mutant proteins were still bound to Ds and Ft (<xref rid="app2" ref-type="sec">Figures S1</xref>C and S1D) and were localized, like the wild-type protein, in the Golgi (data not shown). Furthermore, unlike the wild-type protein, these mutated molecules were inactive in vivo, either in the presence or in the absence of endogenous wild-type Fj protein (data not shown; <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figures 1</xref>E–1I). These results argue that the kinase activity of Fj is essential for its function. By coimmunoprecipitation, we detected physical interactions between two regions of Fj and the cadherin repeats 1–5 of both Ft and Ds, again consistent with Fj acting on both molecules (<xref rid="app2" ref-type="sec">Figures S1</xref>E–S1G).</p>

        <title>Fj Inhibits Binding of Ds to Ft</title>
        <p>Ft and Ds can form heterodimers, intercellular bridges conveying polarity information from cell to cell [<xref rid="bib4 bib5 bib6 bib7" ref-type="bibr">4–7</xref>], and we now tested whether phosphorylation of Ds and/or Ft by Fj might regulate this heterodimerization. When <italic>Drosophila</italic> S2 cells were separately transfected with Ft and Ds and then mixed together, they formed cell aggregates; Ds and Ft appeared to stabilize each other's localization at the cell membrane (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>A) [<xref rid="bib4 bib5 bib6" ref-type="bibr">4–6</xref>]. We cotransfected <italic>Drosophila</italic> S2 cells with <italic>fj</italic> or <italic>GNT-fj</italic>, a Golgi-tethered form of the protein that is more active in vivo [<xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>], plus either <italic>ft</italic> or <italic>ds</italic>. <italic>fj</italic> was expressed under the control of a Cu<sup>2+</sup>-inducible promoter, whereas <italic>ft</italic> and <italic>ds</italic> were expressed under constitutive actin promoters (<xref rid="app2" ref-type="sec">Figure S2</xref>A). Without the addition of CuSO<sub>4</sub>, no detectable Fj was expressed (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figures 2</xref>A and 2F). We then measured the amount of cell aggregation between these doubly transfected cells and cells singly transfected with <italic>ft</italic> or <italic>ds</italic>.</p>
        <p>Strong mutual stabilization of Ft and Ds at the interface between cells occurred when no Fj was expressed (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>A). However, when <italic>fj</italic> or <italic>GNT-fj</italic> was coexpressed with <italic>ds</italic>, this mutual stabilization of Ft and Ds was reduced (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>B), and fewer clumps of cells were recorded. To quantify the level of binding between cells, we counted the percentage of Ft cells in the population adhering to Ds cells and compared these data with and without CuSO<sub>4</sub> (±Fj expression) (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figures 2</xref>D and 2E). When <italic>fj</italic> was induced in <italic>ds</italic>-expressing cells, the binding between <italic>ft</italic>- and <italic>ds</italic>-expressing cells was reduced by 40% (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>D). The GNT-Fj form, which is not secreted from cells, was at least as potent as wild-type Fj in inhibiting Ds binding to Ft (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>D), consistent with Fj mediating its effect in the Golgi [<xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>], and not at the cell surface.</p>
        <p>No significant effect on Ft-Ds binding was observed when either <italic>fj</italic> or <italic>GNT-fj</italic> was coexpressed with <italic>ft</italic> (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>E). Both the in vivo genetic evidence described above, along with the observation that Ft cadherin domains can be phosphorylated by Fj (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>K; [<xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]), suggest that Fj might also act on Ft. But if Fj acts on Ft to modulate its binding to Ds, our in vitro assays failed to reveal it.</p>
        <p>To determine whether it is the kinase activity of Fj that is responsible for the inhibition of binding, we tested forms of GNT-Fj that were mutated in the kinase domain. When each one of the three mutant Fj proteins was expressed with <italic>ds</italic> in the cell aggregation assay, they, unlike the wild-type protein, had no significant effect on binding (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>D). Furthermore, stabilization of Ft and Ds at the membrane did not seem to be altered by expression of <italic>GNT-fj<sup>D454Q</sup></italic> (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>C). Therefore, the kinase activity of Fj is required in the Ds-expressing cells to modify Ft-Ds binding.</p>
        <p>Because Fj is known to phosphorylate Ds cadherin domains (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>J; [<xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]), its effects are most likely implemented via changes in the mutual binding affinity of Ft and Ds. But they could also be explained if the level or localization of Ds protein was altered by <italic>fj</italic> expression. To test for this, we expressed <italic>GNT-fj</italic> with <italic>ds-EGFP</italic> and found that Fj does not change the level of Ds-EGFP protein by western blot (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>F), indicating that overall levels of Ds protein are not altered. Importantly, we also determined that the level of Ds that reaches the cell surface was not significantly altered (<xref rid="app2" ref-type="sec">Figure S2</xref>B). These results support the view that it is indeed the binding affinity between Ft and Ds that is modified by Fj.</p>
        <p>Finally, we carried out coimmunoprecipitation experiments between fragments of Ds and Ft, known to bind to each other in cell aggregation assays (<xref rid="app2" ref-type="sec">Figure S2</xref>C), and confirmed again that Fj kinase activity modulates Ft-Ds binding. A secreted form of HA-tagged Ds that contains the first five cadherin domains (Ds1-5sec), including amino acid S236, which is phosphorylated by Fj [<xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>], was expressed in cells in the presence of either Golgi-tethered <italic>GNT-fj</italic> or (as controls) forms of <italic>GNT-fj</italic> mutated in the kinase domain. In this assay, expression of <italic>GNT-fj</italic> significantly reduced the amount of Ds1-5sec that was pulled down with Ft1-5 when compared to each of the three <italic>GNT-fj</italic> kinase mutants (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figures 2</xref>G and 2H). Hence, Fj phosphorylation of Ds1-5 alters its binding affinity for Ft1-5.</p>

      <sec id="sec1.4">
        <title>Mutation of Phosphorylation Sites in Ds Alters Its Ability to Bind to Ft</title>
        <p>Ishikawa et al. [<xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] identified three conserved serines (S236, S561, and S881) in Ds cadherin domains that can be phosphorylated by Fj in vitro or in cell-based assays (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>A). We mutated these three serines in <italic>ds-EGFP</italic> to alanine to obviate phosphorylation at these sites (<italic>ds<sup>S&gt;Ax3</sup>-EGFP</italic>). Mutation of these serines did not disrupt the levels of expression or cell-surface localization (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figures 3</xref>C and 3D). Nor did it significantly impact on the behavior of the protein: in the absence of <italic>fj</italic> expression, <italic>ds<sup>S&gt;Ax3</sup>-EGFP</italic>-expressing cells can still bind to <italic>ft</italic>-expressing cells at a similar level as do wild-type <italic>ds-EGFP</italic>-expressing cells (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>B). But, in the cell aggregation assay, <italic>ds<sup>S&gt;Ax3</sup>-EGFP</italic>-expressing cells did not respond to coexpression of <italic>GNT-Fj</italic>, unlike control <italic>ds-EGFP</italic>-expressing cells (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>B). These results argue that these three phosphorylation sites are instrumental in the modulation of Ft-Ds binding affinity by Fj.</p>
        <p>To make a phosphomimetic form of Ds, we mutated each of these three serines to aspartates so as to add a negative charge, much like phosphorylation itself does (<italic>ds<sup>S&gt;Dx3</sup>-EGFP</italic>). We first confirmed that Ds<sup>S&gt;Dx3</sup>-EGFP protein was expressed at a similar level to Ds-EGFP and Ds<sup>S&gt;Ax3</sup>-EGFP by western blot (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>C) and that the level of protein at the cell surface was similar (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>D). However, we found that <italic>ds<sup>S&gt;Dx3</sup>-EGFP</italic>-expressing cells had a significantly reduced level of binding to Ft cells when compared to wild-type <italic>ds-EGFP</italic>- or <italic>ds<sup>S&gt;Ax3</sup>-EGFP</italic>-expressing cells (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>B), although we noted that the reduction was not as strong as when Ds-EGFP was modified by Fj, suggesting that the S&gt;D substitution is not a perfect phosphomimetic. Nevertheless, consistent with all of our findings, mimicking phosphorylation at these sites reduced binding to Ft. Coexpression of <italic>GNT-Fj</italic> with <italic>ds<sup>S&gt;Dx3</sup>-EGFP</italic> did not reduce binding further (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>B), indicating that if there were additional sites in Ds that could be phosphorylated, they do not contribute significantly to the regulation of Ft-Ds binding.</p>
      </sec>
      <sec id="sec1.5">
        <title>Phosphorylation of Ds Is Relevant In Vivo</title>
        <p>To investigate the importance of the Ds phosphorylation sites in vivo, we assayed the activity of the Ds<sup>S&gt;Ax3</sup>-EGFP and Ds<sup>S&gt;Dx3</sup>-EGFP proteins in flies. We generated transgenic flies that expressed <italic>ds<sup>S&gt;Ax3</sup>-EGFP</italic> and <italic>ds<sup>S&gt;Dx3</sup>-EGFP</italic>, as well as wild-type <italic>ds-EGFP</italic>, under the control of the <italic>Act5C</italic> promoter. To ensure that all forms of Ds were expressed at the same level, we used site-specific integration to insert the transgenes at the same chromosomal location.</p>
        <p>To assay the activity of the transgenes, we looked at their effects on wing size, a parameter modulated by Fj, Ds, and Ft through their regulation of the Warts/Hippo pathway [<xref rid="bib1 bib3" ref-type="bibr">1, 3</xref>]. Loss of <italic>ds</italic> activity did not much alter wing area (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>F) but did affect wing shape (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>B). However, uniform Ds expression reduces the area of the wing [<xref rid="bib5 bib18 bib19 bib20" ref-type="bibr">5, 18–20</xref>], which we also see if we express <italic>Act-ds-EGFP</italic> uniformly in a <italic>ds</italic> background (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figures 4</xref>C and 4F). Notably, removal of <italic>fj</italic> from these <italic>ds<sup>−</sup>, Act-ds-EGFP</italic> wings reduced their size dramatically (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figures 4</xref>C′ and 4F; <xref rid="app2" ref-type="sec">Figure S3</xref>B), even though removing <italic>fj</italic> from <italic>ds</italic><sup>−</sup> wings had only a minor effect (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figures 4</xref>B′ and 4F; <xref rid="app2" ref-type="sec">Figure S3</xref>A). Hence, in the presence of <italic>ds</italic> activity, <italic>fj</italic> has a potent and easily measurable effect on wing size.</p>
        <p>Importantly, the wings of <italic>ds<sup>−</sup>, Act-ds<sup>S&gt;Ax3</sup>-EGFP</italic> flies (expressing the unphosphorylatable form of Ds) were indistinguishable in size and shape from those of <italic>ds<sup>−</sup> fj<sup>−</sup>, Act-ds-EGFP</italic> flies (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figures 4</xref>C′, 4D, and 4F), and their size was not further altered if <italic>fj</italic> was removed (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figures 4</xref>D′ and 4F; <xref rid="app2" ref-type="sec">Figure S3</xref>C). When uniformly expressed, the phosphomimetic form of Ds (Ds<sup>S&gt;Dx3</sup><italic>-</italic>EGFP) also affected wing area (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figures 4</xref>E and 4F) and was likewise insensitive to the presence of Fj (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figures 4</xref>E′ and 4F; <xref rid="app2" ref-type="sec">Figure S3</xref>D). From these results, we conclude that the effects of Fj on wing size in this assay depend on the three key phosphorylation sites.</p>
        <p>Recent data suggest that steeply graded Fj distribution and, consequently, steeply graded Ft-Ds activity promote growth [<xref rid="bib3 bib18 bib20" ref-type="bibr">3, 18, 20</xref>]. And, consistent with this, overexpression of evenly expressed <italic>fj</italic>, which should tend to flatten a Ft-Ds gradient of activity, decreases wing size [<xref rid="bib5 bib11 bib18 bib19 bib20" ref-type="bibr">5, 11, 18–20</xref>]. Further, the reduction in wing size we now see in <italic>ds<sup>−</sup> fj<sup>−</sup>, Act-ds-EGFP</italic> wings is again consistent because Ds-EGFP is, presumably, evenly distributed. Overall, our results are consistent with the hypothesis that graded Fj activity (and hence graded Ft-Ds binding) is a determinant of wing size.</p>
        <p>We note that Ds<sup>S&gt;Dx3</sup> might be expected to mimic the effect of uniform Fj on the wing, which reduces wing size [<xref rid="bib18 bib20" ref-type="bibr">18, 20</xref>], and indeed, <italic>ds<sup>−</sup>, ds<sup>S&gt;Dx3</sup>-EGFP</italic> wings are smaller than <italic>ds<sup>−</sup>, ds-EGFP</italic> wings (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figures 4</xref>C, 4E, and 4F). However, <italic>ds<sup>−</sup>, ds<sup>S&gt;Dx3</sup>-EGFP</italic> wings are slightly larger than <italic>ds<sup>−</sup>, ds<sup>S&gt;Ax3</sup>-EGFP</italic> wings (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figures 4</xref>D–4F; <xref rid="app2" ref-type="sec">Figure S3</xref>E), which mimic the effect of loss of <italic>fj</italic> activity. A likely explanation for this difference in size is that in vivo, as in vitro, Ds<sup>S&gt;Dx3</sup> binds less strongly than Ds<sup>S&gt;Ax3</sup> to Ft, resulting in reduced Ft/Ds-mediated suppression of growth. Taken together, our data indicate that the primary effect of Fj on wing size is mediated by modulating the steepness of the Ft-Ds-binding gradient, with a smaller contribution attributable to the effect of Fj on overall strength of Ft-Ds binding.</p>
        <p>We also studied planar polarity and found that our results argue that the same three phosphorylation sites in Ds are important for the planar polarity function of Fj. Ds-EGFP expression almost completely rescued the polarity defects seen in <italic>ds<sup>−</sup></italic> wings (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figures 4</xref>G–4I; <xref rid="app2" ref-type="sec">Figure S3</xref>G–S3I and S3K). Notably, in these wings (that lack graded <italic>ds</italic> expression), Fj activity made a contribution to planar polarity patterning, because its removal caused swirls (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>H′; <xref rid="app2" ref-type="sec">Figures S3</xref>H′ and S3K), indicating that, as in growth, Fj regulation of Ft-Ds binding is required for planar polarity. Both the <italic>ds<sup>−</sup>, Act-ds<sup>S&gt;Ax3</sup>-EGFP</italic> and <italic>ds<sup>−</sup>, Act-ds<sup>S&gt;Dx3</sup>-EGFP</italic> mutant wings show swirls around veins 3 and 4, similar to <italic>ds<sup>−</sup> fj<sup>−</sup>, Act-ds-EGFP</italic> wings, consistent with a role for these phosphorylation sites in regulating planar polarity. However, in these genotypes, removal of <italic>fj</italic> causes a slight increase in the polarity phenotype, with swirls now seen above vein 3 (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figures 4</xref>J and 4J′; <xref rid="app2" ref-type="sec">Figures S3</xref>J–S3K), indicating that in the context of planar polarity, Fj can act either via an alternative mechanism on Ds itself or via another molecule, for example Ft.</p>
        <p>Overall, our results argue that Fj affects wing size via phosphorylation of Ds at the three identified residues. Furthermore, these sites also act to mediate effects of Fj on planar polarity.</p>

        <title>Conclusions</title>
        <p><italic>fj</italic> was first shown to interact with <italic>ds</italic> by Waddington [<xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>], and subsequent studies showed that it regulates the functions of <italic>ds</italic> and <italic>ft</italic> [<xref rid="bib4 bib6 bib7 bib8 bib9 bib12" ref-type="bibr">4, 6–9, 12</xref>]. Fj has recently been found to act in the Golgi [<xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] and mediate the phosphorylation of a subset of cadherin repeats of both Ft and Ds [<xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>], but the function in vivo of this phosphorylation was not known. Here we have restricted our attentions largely to the action of Fj on Ds. We show that phosphorylation of Ds by Fj reduces the binding affinity of Ds for Ft, indicating that phosphorylation of Ds is important in the regulation of Ft/Ds heterodimerization and therefore of downstream consequences on growth and planar polarity. Furthermore, we find that, in vivo, a specific set of three phosphorylation sites in the Ds protein is required for Fj to mediate effects (via Ds) on the regulation of wing size and planar polarity. Our data additionally reveal that, in vivo, Fj also acts via Ft, even in the absence of Ds, although we have not found the mechanism. A possibility is that Fj phosphorylation of Ft promotes its binding to Ds, but we did not detect this in our assay. In this context, note that it might seem counterintuitive if phosphorylation of residues in Ft were to increase binding and if phosphorylation of analogous residues in Ds were to decrease binding. But, in any case, characterizing how Ft and Ds interact with each other is central to understanding how these giant cadherin molecules together regulate growth and polarity of tissues.</p>

        <p>Constructs were generated via standard molecular biology techniques, and mutagenized and polymerase chain reaction-amplified regions were verified by sequencing. <italic>ds</italic> and <italic>ft</italic> constructs were expressed under control of the <italic>Act5C</italic> promoter in both tissue culture experiments and transgenic flies. Full-length <italic>ds</italic> was created from <italic>ds</italic> cDNA fragments (gift from M. Noll) [<xref rid="bib22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. The untagged form lacks the final 303 aa because of a premature stop codon in the original cDNA, which was corrected in the Ds-EGFP form. Point mutations in the cadherin domains were introduced with QuikChange Multi Site-Directed Mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). Full-length <italic>ft</italic> was a 22 kb genomic fragment from BACR11D14, containing the entire coding sequence. Ft1-5 and Ds1-5 contained the first five cadherin repeats, followed by the complete transmembrane and cytoplasmic domains. Ds1-5sec and Ft1-5sec were truncated after the first five cadherin domains, and these constructs were C-terminally Myc-, HA-, GFP-, or RFP-tagged via the <italic>Drosophila</italic> Gateway system. <italic>fj</italic> constructs were expressed under upstream activating sequence (UAS) control [<xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>] in transgenic flies, under the copper-inducible metallothionein promoter in the vector pMK33B for tissue culture experiments, and in the pENTR vector for the coimmunoprecipitation experiments in which they were additionally Myc tagged. The Golgi-tethered forms were made by swapping the appropriate region of the coding sequence into GNT-Fj [<xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>].</p>

        <p>Fj Can Modulate the Activity of Both Ft and Ds In Vivo</p>
        <p>(A–I) Images of clones (outlined in red) in the dorsal abdomen marked with the hair morphology markers <italic>stc</italic> (A–D) or <italic>pwn</italic> (E–I). Arrows indicate the direction and extent of hair repolarization around the clones.</p>
        <p>(A) <italic>ds<sup>−</sup> ft<sup>−</sup> UAS.ectoDs</italic> clones strongly repolarize hairs behind the clone (100% of clones repolarize with a maximum range of up to seven cells [n = 38]).</p>
        <p>(B) Repolarization around <italic>ds<sup>−</sup> ft<sup>−</sup> UAS.ectoDs UAS.fj</italic> clones is much reduced (48% of clones show some repolarization with a range of one to three cells [n = 48]).</p>
        <p>(C) <italic>ds<sup>−</sup> ft<sup>−</sup> UAS.ft</italic> clones cause repolarization in front of clones (64% of clones repolarize with a maximum range of four cells [n = 25]).</p>
        <p>(D) Coexpression of <italic>UAS.ft</italic> and <italic>UAS.fj</italic> in <italic>ds<sup>−</sup> ft</italic><sup>−</sup> clones strengthens repolarization (95% of clones repolarized with a maximum range of seven cells [n = 39)).</p>
        <p>(E) <italic>fj</italic><sup>−</sup> clones reverse hair polarity behind the clone (11 of 39 clones, 0 reverse in front).</p>
        <p>(F) Expression of <italic>UAS.fj</italic> in <italic>fj</italic><sup>−</sup> clones rescues the mutant phenotype (and reverses hairs in front of the clone, see [<xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]), 19 of 25 clones reverse in front, 0 reverse behind; similarly, 21 of 25 <italic>UAS.fj</italic> clones in wild-type flies reverse in front, 0 reverse behind—the comparison suggesting that <italic>UAS.fj</italic> is strongly overexpressed.</p>
        <p>(G–I) None of the mutated forms of <italic>fj</italic> rescue <italic>fj</italic><sup>−</sup>, the hairs still being reversed behind the clones upon expression of <italic>UAS.fj<sup>D447Q</sup></italic> (10 of 28 clones) (G), <italic>UAS.fj<sup>D454Q</sup></italic> (11 of 39 clones) (H), and <italic>UAS.fj<sup>D490Q</sup></italic> (12 of 29 clones) (I).</p>
        <p>(J and K) Truncated forms of Ds and Ft (Ds1-5sec-HA and Ft1-5sec-HA), consisting of the first five cadherin repeats, show reduced mobility on western blots, indicative of modification by phosphorylation [<xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] when coexpressed with wild-type Fj in D.mel2 cells but not when coexpressed with the three kinase mutants. This mobility shift is reversed by treatment with phosphatase (<xref rid="app2" ref-type="sec">Figure S1</xref>B).</p>

        <p>Fj Kinase Activity Inhibits Ds Binding to Ft</p>
        <p>(A–C) Confocal images showing protein distribution revealed by immunofluorescence of S2 cell aggregates from example binding assays. Cells are labeled for Ft (red), Ds-EGFP (green), and Fj (blue). Scale bar represents 10 μm. S2 cells were doubly transfected with <italic>pAct-ds-EGFP</italic> and <italic>pMK33B-GNT-fj</italic> (A and B) or <italic>pAct-ds-EGFP</italic> and <italic>pMK33B-GNT-Fj<sup>D454Q</sup></italic> (C) and mixed with cells transfected with <italic>pAct-ft</italic>. Fj expression was induced by addition of 0.14 mM CuSO<sub>4</sub> (B and C). Ft and Ds bind in neighboring cells, stabilizing each other's localization at the cell surface and forming aggregates (A). GNT-Fj expression appears to reduce the stabilization of Ft and Ds at cell contacts (B), whereas GNT-Fj<sup>D454Q</sup> expression does not (C).</p>
        <p>(D and E) Quantifications of Ft-Ds binding in cell aggregation assays. The percent of <italic>ft</italic> cells in the population that bind to <italic>ds</italic> cells was determined. <italic>pAct-ds</italic> (D) or <italic>pAct-ft</italic> (E) was cotransfected with either empty <italic>pMK33B</italic> or <italic>pMK33B</italic> expressing <italic>fj</italic>, <italic>GNT-fj</italic>, <italic>GNT-fj<sup>D447Q</sup></italic>, <italic>GNT-fj<sup>D454Q</sup></italic>, or <italic>GNT-fj<sup>D490Q</sup></italic>, and these cells then mixed with cells singly transfected with either <italic>pAct-ft</italic> (D) or <italic>pAct-ds</italic> (E). Binding of cells in the absence of CuSO<sub>4</sub> (light gray) was compared to binding in the presence of CuSO<sub>4</sub> (to induce Fj expression, dark gray) (0.14 mM in D and 0.7 mM in E) to determine whether Fj expression significantly altered binding. Graphs show the mean from five separate experiments; error bars show standard deviation. Student's t tests were applied (<sup>∗∗∗</sup>p &lt; 0.005 between pairs of columns indicated by bars); NS, not significant.</p>
        <p>(F) Western blot showing Ds-EGFP, Fj, and tubulin levels in S2 cell extracts in the presence or absence of GNT-Fj or GNT-Fj<sup>D454Q</sup>. Note the efficacy of CuSO<sub>4</sub>.</p>
        <p>(G) Coimmunoprecipitation of Ds1-5sec-HA with Ft1-5-Myc. D.mel2 cells were transfected with Ds1-5sec-HA and either <italic>pMK33B-GNT-Fj</italic> or kinase mutants. Addition of CuSO<sub>4</sub> (0.14 mM) induced GNT-Fj expression in secreting cells (bottom). Medium containing secreted Ds1-5sec-HA (INPUT:HA) was incubated with cell lysate containing Ft1-5-Myc. Anti-Myc antibodies were used to pull down Ft1-5-Myc, and anti-HA was used to detect Ds1-5sec-HA. Control (right) is a mock immunoprecipitation without Ft1-5-Myc expression. Note that in this experiment, because of variations in transfection efficiency, the Ds1-5sec-HA-secreting cells transfected with wild-type GNT-Fj express a lower level of Fj than those transfected with mutant forms of GNT-Fj; however, even this lower level of kinase-active Fj results in a significant reduction in the amount of Ds1-5sec-HA pulled down.</p>
        <p>(H) Quantitation of five experiments as shown in (G). Amount of pull-down is shown in arbitrary units. Error bars show standard deviation. Wild-type Fj significantly reduces pull-down of Ds1-5sec as compared to the three kinase mutant forms (p &lt; 0.005).</p>

        <p>Ds Phosphorylation Sites Mediate the Effects of Fj on Ft-Ds Binding Affinity</p>
        <p>(A) Diagram representing the structure of Ds protein and localization of phosphorylation sites. Ovals represent the cadherin domains of Ds. Dark gray marks the cadherin domains containing serines that were shown in S2 cells to be phosphorylated by Fj (CAD3 [S236], CAD6 [S561], CAD9 [S881]), and light gray represents cadherin domains containing conserved S/T residues that have not been shown to be phosphorylated by Fj [<xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>].</p>
        <p>(B) Cell aggregation assay with Ds phosphorylation mutants. <italic>pAct-ds-EGFP</italic>, <italic>ds<sup>S&gt;Ax3</sup>-EGFP</italic> (S236A, S561A, S881A), or <italic>ds<sup>S&gt;Dx3</sup>-EGFP</italic> (S236D, S561D, S881D) was cotransfected with <italic>pMK33B</italic> empty vector or <italic>pMK33B-GNT-fj</italic>. The percentage of Ft-expressing cells binding to Ds-EGFP-expressing cells was determined. Binding of cells in the absence of CuSO<sub>4</sub> (light gray) was compared to binding in the presence of 0.14 mM CuSO<sub>4</sub> (dark gray) to determine whether Fj expression made a significant difference to binding (n = 3, error bars show standard deviation). Student's t tests were applied (<sup>∗∗∗</sup>p &lt; 0.005) and are indicated for each pair of columns (±Cu). In addition, of the first eight columns (four column pairs), only column 4 (Ds + GNT-Fj, +Cu) shows a significant difference from column 1 (Ds, -Cu). The level of binding of Ft to Ds<sup>S&gt;Dx3</sup>-EGFP cells (columns 9 and 11) was significantly lower than to Ds-EGFP (column 1) and Ds<sup>S&gt;Ax3</sup>-EGFP (column 5) (p &lt; 0.005). Note also that the level of binding of Ds<sup>S&gt;Dx3</sup>-EGFP cells (column 9) is not as low as Ds-EGFP when GNT-Fj (column 4) is coexpressed (p &lt; 0.05), suggesting that phosphorylation of the serine residues has a stronger effect on the affinity of binding of Ds to Ft than mutation of these serine residues to aspartate.</p>
        <p>(C) Western blot comparing levels of Ds-EGFP, Ds<sup>S&gt;Ax3</sup>-EGFP, and Ds<sup>S&gt;Dx3</sup>-EGFP expression in transfected S2 cells.</p>

        <p>(F) Quantitation of wing blade area, relative to wild-type. Twenty wings from male flies were measured per genotype; error bars show standard deviation. Genotypes can be compared directly with wings pictured above (A–E′ written in columns). Student's t tests were applied (<sup>∗∗∗</sup>p &lt; 0.005, comparisons between columns linked by bars). For (B) (<italic>ds</italic><sup>−</sup>) and (B′) (<italic>ds</italic><sup>−</sup><italic>fj</italic><sup>−</sup>), a small difference in wing size was found (<sup>∗</sup>p &lt; 0.05) only after measuring 40 wings. This difference in size suggests that <italic>fj</italic> can have a small effect on wing size even in the absence of <italic>ds</italic> activity, although the mechanisms are unclear.</p>
