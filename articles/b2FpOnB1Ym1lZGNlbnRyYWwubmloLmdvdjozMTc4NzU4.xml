        <p>Voltage-dependent type 7 K<sup>+</sup> (K<sub>V</sub>7) channels play important physiological roles in neurons and muscle cells. The aims of the present study were to investigate the motor effects of K<sub>V</sub>7 channel modulators in the rat gastric fundus and the expression of K<sub>V</sub>7 channels in this tissue.</p>
        <p>Muscle tone and electrical field stimulation (EFS)-evoked relaxations of precontracted longitudinal muscle strips of the rat gastric fundus were investigated under nonadrenergic noncholinergic conditions by organ bath studies. Gene expression was studied by real-time PCR and tissue localization of channels was investigated by immunohistochemistry.</p>
        <p>The K<sub>V</sub>7 channel blocker XE-991 induced concentration-dependent contractions, with mean pD<sub>2</sub> and <italic>E</italic><sub>max</sub> of 5.4 and 48% of the maximal U46619-induced contraction, respectively. The K<sub>V</sub>7 channel activators retigabine and flupirtine concentration-dependently relaxed U46619-precontracted strips, with pD<sub>2</sub>s of 4.7 and 4.4 and <italic>E</italic><sub>max</sub> of 93% and 91% of the maximal relaxation induced by papaverine, respectively. XE-991 concentration-dependently inhibited retigabine-induced relaxation with a pIC<sub>50</sub> of 6.2. XE-991 and DMP-543, another K<sub>V</sub>7 channel blocker, increased by 13–25% or reduced by 11–21% the relaxations evoked by low- or high-frequency EFS, respectively. XE-991 also reduced the relaxation induced by vasoactive intestinal polypeptide (VIP) by 33% of controls. Transcripts encoded by all K<sub>V</sub>7 genes were detected in the fundus, with 7.4 and 7.5 showing the highest expression levels. K<sub>V</sub>7.4 and 7.5 channels were visualized by confocal immunofluorescence in both circular and longitudinal muscle layers.</p>
        <p>In conclusion, in the rat proximal stomach, K<sub>V</sub>7 channels appear to contribute to the resting muscle tone and to VIP- and high-frequency EFS-induced relaxation. K<sub>V</sub>7 channel activators could be useful relaxant agents of the gastric smooth muscle.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>In mammalian cells, K<sup>+</sup> channels are involved in several physiological processes, such as neurotransmitter and hormone release, motor activity of muscle cells, regulation of water-electrolyte balance and epithelial secretion <xref rid="bib0005" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>. Opening of K<sup>+</sup> channels hyperpolarizes the resting membrane potential and decreases cell excitability. Many K<sup>+</sup> channel subtypes in different cell types of the gastrointestinal tract (epithelial, smooth muscle cells [SMC], interstitial cells of Cajal [ICC], fibroblast-like cells [FLC] and neurons) are involved in gut secretory and motor activities. By differentially controlling the membrane resting potential of SMC–ICC–FLC syncytial apparatus in the various gut segments, K<sup>+</sup> channels participate to the region-dependent differences in basal muscle tone levels <xref rid="bib0010" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>. Opening of K<sup>+</sup> channels is among the signal transduction mechanisms activated by the neurotransmitters released from the inhibitory motor neurons <xref rid="bib0010" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>. Voltage-dependent K<sup>+</sup> (K<sub>V</sub>) channels are particularly expressed in the GI tract; indeed, K<sub>V</sub>1.2, 1.5, 1.6, 2.2, 4.1, 4.3, 7, 11.1 and 12.1 transcripts and/or proteins have been shown in the GI tract, with K<sub>V</sub>1.2 and 2.2 playing a dominant role in regulating SMC contractility <xref rid="bib0010" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>.</p>
      <p>The K<sub>V</sub>7 channel subfamily includes 5 members (K<sub>V</sub>7.1–7.5), each with distinct expression pattern and functional roles. K<sub>V</sub>7.1 channels mediate the slowly activating K<sup>+</sup> current (<italic>I</italic><sub>Ks</sub>) involved in the late repolarizing phase of the action potential in cardiomyocytes <xref rid="bib0015" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>. In neuronal cells, K<sub>V</sub>7.2, 7.3 and 7.5 represent the molecular basis of the M current (<italic>I</italic><sub>KM</sub>), a slowly activating and deactivating current inhibited by muscarinic receptors stimulation, that modulates cell excitability and firing pattern <xref rid="bib0020 bib0025" ref-type="bibr">[4,5]</xref>. K<sub>V</sub>7.4 channels have been first described in the inner ear and auditory neurons <xref rid="bib0030" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref> and more recently in skeletal muscle cells <xref rid="bib0035" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>. K<sub>V</sub>7 channels have been shown to regulate vascular, gastrointestinal and genitourinary smooth muscle activity <xref rid="bib0040 bib0045 bib0050 bib0055" ref-type="bibr">[8–11]</xref>. In the gastrointestinal tract, acetylcholine has been long known to increase the membrane excitability of toad <xref rid="bib0060" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref> and guinea-pig <xref rid="bib0065" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref> gastric SMC through the inhibition of a voltage-dependent K<sup>+</sup> current active at resting membrane potential, having properties similar to neuronal <italic>I</italic><sub>KM</sub>. This evidence might suggest that K<sub>V</sub>7 channels are expressed in the SMC–ICC–FLC syncytial apparatus of the stomach and their inhibition mediate acetylcholine-induced electrophysiological effects. The expression of K<sub>V</sub>7 channels and the motor effects of K<sub>V</sub>7 channel modulators have been investigated in the mouse colon <xref rid="bib0045" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>. In the same study, all K<sub>V</sub>7 channel gene transcripts have been shown to be expressed in both gastric fundus and antrum in the mouse, with K<sub>V</sub>7.4 and 7.5 showing the highest levels <xref rid="bib0045" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>. Only the expression of K<sub>V</sub>7.1–7.3 channel genes has been investigated in the rat stomach <xref rid="bib0070" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>. K<sub>V</sub>7.1 and 7.3 channel mRNAs were detected in the whole stomach and their levels were relatively high in the antrum but very low in the fundus <xref rid="bib0070" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>.</p>
      <p>The proximal stomach plays an important “reservoir” function, i.e. it accommodates high volumes of food bolus with small increases in intraluminal pressure. The accommodative gastric function occurs mostly through the active reflex neural nonadrenergic noncholinergic (NANC) relaxation of the smooth muscle. <italic>In vitro</italic> preparations of the rat proximal stomach passively and progressively relax under a constant load during the equilibration period and generally stabilize on a very low basal muscle tone. In addition, they show a very low phasic muscle activity. <italic>In vivo</italic>, gastric tone appears to be maintained by vagally mediated cholinergic input <xref rid="bib0075" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>. The most probable neurotransmitters released by the inhibitory motor neurons are nitric oxide (NO) and vasoactive intestinal polypeptide (VIP). NO is mainly responsible for the rapid beginning and the high speed of the initial phase of the relaxation, whereas VIP and its related peptide, peptide histidine isoleucine (PHI), are mainly involved in the long duration of the inhibitory response evoked by high-frequency neuronal activation <xref rid="bib0080" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>. At least a third component, probably produced by a non-purinergic neurotransmitter acting via apamin-sensitive mechanisms, seems also to be present <xref rid="bib0085" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>. It is well known that NO and VIP mainly act through the activation of soluble guanylate cyclase and VPAC2 receptors followed by stimulation of adenylate cyclase through G<sub>s</sub> protein, respectively. However, the final molecular mechanisms linked to the relaxation have not been fully elucidated in the rat gastric fundus. In addition, the ion channels contributing to the membrane resting potential of the SMC–ICC–FLC syncytial apparatus of the rat gastric fundus have not been definitively characterized. In particular, a characterization of the role of K<sub>V</sub>7 channels in the motor activity of rat proximal stomach has never been performed. In this study, we investigated the effects of K<sub>V</sub>7 channel modulators on the resting muscle tone and on the NANC relaxation of the rat gastric fundus. The effects of K<sub>V</sub>7 channel blockade on the relaxations induced by NO and VIP were also evaluated. The results of the present study indicate that K<sub>V</sub>7 channels play important roles in the maintenance of the low muscle tone in resting conditions and in the VIP-induced relaxation in the rat gastric fundus. Altogether, the results obtained provide the first functional demonstration of a critical control exerted by K<sub>V</sub>7 channels over rat proximal stomach motor activity, revealing a novel pharmacological target for therapeutic interventions against gastric motor disturbances.</p>

          <p>Wistar rats of either sex, weighing 180–320 g, were fasted overnight with free access to water, afterwards killed by decapitation and exsanguinated. The gastric fundus was removed and two longitudinal muscle strips (3 × 20 mm) were prepared according to the method of Vane <xref rid="bib0090" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref> in a Krebs solution of the following composition (mM): NaCl 118.5, KCl 4.8, CaCl<sub>2</sub> 1.9, KH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub> 1.2, MgSO<sub>4</sub> 1.2, NaHCO<sub>3</sub> 25 and glucose 10.1 (pH 7.4). The strips were mounted between parallel platinum electrodes (22 mm long, 4 mm wide and 5.5 mm apart) and suspended in Krebs solution maintained at 37 °C and bubbled with a 95/5 O<sub>2</sub>/CO<sub>2</sub> mixture inside 5-ml organ baths. The strips were connected to isotonic transducers (model 7006; Ugo Basile Biological Research Apparatus, Comerio, Italy) under a 1-g load. Smooth muscle activity was recorded on a computer using the PowerLab data acquisition system (ADInstruments, Castle Hill, Australia). Isolated EFSs, consisting of rectangular and bipolar pulses of constant duration (1 ms) and amplitude (120 mA), were performed via platinum plate electrodes by a stimulator (model 6012; Palmer Bioscience, now Harvard Apparatus Ltd., Edenbridge, UK) linked in series with a 4-channel constant-current unit (model Multiplexing Pulse Booster; Ugo Basile Biological Research Apparatus). Tissues were initially allowed to equilibrate for 40 min in Krebs solution. After this period, in all experimental series, the bath solution also contained atropine (1 μM) and guanethidine (5 μM) (to achieve NANC conditions). Strips were allowed to equilibrate for 20 more min in this bath solution. The incubation medium was always changed every 10 min (during the equilibration period and in between drug administration and/or periods of EFS).</p>

          <p>In a first series of experiments, the strips were exposed to consecutive 5-min incubations with increasing concentrations of 9,11-dideoxy-9α,11α-methanoepoxy prostaglandin F<sub>2α</sub> (U46619, 1 nM to 1 μM), a selective thromboxane receptor (TP) agonist, to investigate the concentration–response relationship for this muscle contracting agent and set the maximal contractile capacity of the strips.

Contractions were expressed as percentages of the effect produced by the maximal concentration used (1 μM).</p>

          <p>In a second series of experiments, the preparations were first contracted by a submaximal concentration (0.1 μM) of U46619. After 10 min, U46619 was washed out from the incubation medium and the strips were allowed to return to basal tone. Then, the strips were exposed to consecutive 5-min incubations with increasing concentrations of the selective K<sub>V</sub>7 channel blocker XE-991 (0.5–100 μM) <xref rid="bib0095" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>. XE-991 was added cumulatively to the incubation medium.

Then, the substance/s was/were washed out from the bath and strip motor activity was recorded for 30–60 min.

          <title>Study of the motor effects induced by K<sub>V</sub>7 channel activators</title>
          <p>In all following series of experiments, the bath solution also contained U46619 (0.1 μM) (to raise strip tone and so enable recording of relaxant responses). Initially, the strips were stimulated twice with EFS (2 Hz, 30 s) to evaluate the quality and the reproducibility of relaxant responses. A 10-min period elapsed between these two initial EFS.</p>
          <p>After 10 more min, the strips were exposed to consecutive incubations with increasing concentrations of retigabine (1–100 μM) or flupirtine (1–144 μM), another substance considered to be a selective activator of neuronal K<sub>V</sub>7 channels <xref rid="bib0020" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>. Since in preliminary experiments the strips fully recovered to basal tone after retigabine washout from the bath, isolated concentration–response curves were performed for this drug. On the contrary, the strips did not fully recover to basal tone after flupirtine washout, so that this second K<sub>V</sub>7 activator was added cumulatively to the incubation medium. Retigabine and flupirtine were left in the bath until peak relaxations were reached, that required 5 or 10 min, respectively. In some strips, the concentration–response curve for flupirtine was studied in the presence of the voltage-dependent Na<sup>+</sup>-channel blocker tetrodotoxin (TTX, 1 μM; pre-incubation time: 10 min) or the voltage-dependent N-type Ca<sup>2+</sup>-channel blocker ω-conotoxin GVIA (CTX GVIA, 30 nM; 10 min). The effects of TTX (1 μM) and CTX GVIA (30 nM) on the relaxation induced by retigabine (100 μM) were also studied. In separate preparations, the effect induced by retigabine (10 or 30 μM) and flupirtine (44 μM) were investigated in the presence of XE-991 (20 μM). Subsequently, to better evaluate the inhibitory effects of XE-991 on retigabine-induced relaxation, the concentration-dependent effects of XE-991 (0.5–20 μM) on the submaximal relaxation induced by retigabine (30 μM) were investigated.</p>

          <title>Effects of K<sub>V</sub>7 channel modulators on the relaxations induced by EFS, NO and VIP</title>
          <p>The strips were subjected to two consecutive EFS (pulse train duration: 2 min), at the frequency, respectively, of 2 and 13 Hz. At these parameters, EFS has been shown to induce submaximal responses in the frequency–response curves based on the amplitude or the area under the curve (AUC) of relaxant responses, respectively <xref rid="bib0105 bib0110" ref-type="bibr">[21,22]</xref>. On the contrary, the amplitude of EFS (13 Hz)-evoked relaxation is a nearly maximal response. Strips were allowed to recover to basal tone prior to the second EFS (usually, 10–15 min elapsed between 2 Hz EFS cessation and 13 Hz EFS beginning). After the induction of these control relaxations and the recovering to basal tone, the strips were exposed to a pharmacological agent and then EFS (2 and 13 Hz) were repeated in its presence. The effects of XE-991 (10–50 μM) and DMP-543 (20 μM), another substance considered to be a selective K<sub>V</sub>7 channel blocker <xref rid="bib0020" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>, were evaluated. Since K<sub>V</sub>7 channel blockers increased strip tone, parallel control strips were studied in which the tone was increased to a similar level by a higher concentration (0.3 μM) of U46619 before the second series of EFS. The effects of XE-991 (20 μM) on the submaximal relaxations produced by 2-min consecutive incubations with NaNO<sub>2</sub> (300 μM) in 0.1 N HCl, a tool used to study NO-induced effects, and VIP (10 nM) were also investigated. Pre-incubation time of drugs was 10 min. In some strips, a low concentration (3 μM) of retigabine was added to the bath medium for 2 min just before 2 Hz and 13 Hz EFS and then maintained in the bath during EFS to investigate its effects on EFS-induced relaxations. A group of untreated strips was used at the same time as the strips treated with the different reagents to check for possible effects due to the time elapsed between the two series of EFS or NaNO<sub>2</sub> and VIP incubations. Each strip was exposed to a single concentration of a pharmacological agent. In separate preparations, the effect of XE-991 (20 μM) on muscle tone was evaluated with TTX (1 μM) or CTX GVIA (30 nM) in the bath.</p>
          <p>At the end of each experiment, each strip was exposed for 5 min to papaverine (300 μM), which induced maximal relaxation. In the experiments in which the effects of flupirtine were investigated, papaverine was usually added to the medium 10 min after flupirtine washout from the bath. In some experiments, however, 20 or 30 min were waited before strip exposure to papaverine to better evaluate the recovery phase of muscle tone. Relaxant responses induced by EFS (2 Hz), NaNO<sub>2</sub> (300 μM) and K<sub>V</sub>7 channel activators or contractions induced by K<sub>V</sub>7 channel blockers were calculated as maximal amplitudes. Those induced by EFS (13 Hz) and VIP (10 nM) were calculated as both maximal amplitudes and AUCs, estimated using the software Chart (ADInstruments). For the analysis, amplitudes of relaxations or contractions and AUC of relaxant responses were normalized using some maximal amplitude parameters. The amplitudes of relaxations or contractions produced by K<sub>V</sub>7 channel activators or blockers, respectively, were expressed as percentages of a maximal amplitude parameter measured from the maximal U46619-induced contraction point (that produced by the first addition of U46619 in the experiments carried out to investigate the concentration-dependent contractile effects induced by XE-991) to the maximal papaverine (300 μM)-induced relaxation point reached at the end of each experiment. As for the relaxant effects induced by EFS or exogenous acidified NaNO<sub>2</sub> and VIP, since they can be differentiated as submaximal responses (amplitudes of relaxations induced by 2 Hz EFS and acidified NaNO<sub>2</sub> and AUC of relaxant responses induced by 13 Hz EFS and VIP) and nearly maximal responses (amplitudes of relaxant effects induced by 13 Hz EFS and VIP) and the K<sub>V</sub>7 channel blockers significantly increase the muscle pre-contraction level, we believed that it was not correct to normalize them with respect to a single parameter. Therefore, the submaximal relaxation amplitudes induced by EFS (2 Hz) or acidified NaNO<sub>2</sub> were expressed as percentages of a maximal amplitude parameter measured from the maximal U46619-induced contraction point reached before the addition of any test substance to the maximal papaverine (300 μM)-induced relaxation point reached at the end of each experiment. Similarly, the submaximal AUCs (mm min) of the relaxant responses induced by 13 Hz EFS and VIP were divided by the maximal amplitude parameter (mm) used to normalize the submaximal relaxation amplitudes induced by EFS (2 Hz) and acidified NaNO<sub>2</sub> and expressed as min <xref rid="bib0110" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>. On the contrary, each maximal relaxation amplitude induced by EFS (13 Hz) or VIP was expressed as a percentage of its own maximal amplitude parameter, measured from the U46619-induced contraction point reached at the start of each EFS- or VIP-induced relaxation to the maximal papaverine (300 μM)-induced relaxation point reached at the end of each experiment. An example of the measurement of the different parameters used to normalize the relaxant responses is given in <xref rid="fig0020" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref>A.</p>

        <p>The gastric fundus was removed from male Wistar rats, weighing 280–320 g and fasted overnight with free access to water, and total RNA was isolated by use of the TRI-Reagent (Sigma–Aldrich, Milan, Italy). RNA was treated with DNase-I (1 U μl<sup>−1</sup>; Sigma–Aldrich) for 15 min at room temperature, followed by spectrophotometric quantification. Final preparation of RNA was considered DNA- and protein-free if the ratio between readings at 260/280 nm was &gt;1.7. Isolated mRNA was reverse-transcribed by use of MuLV high-capacity reverse transcriptase (50 U μl<sup>−1</sup>; Applied Biosystems, Monza, Italy) in a buffer containing 4 mM dNTP, Random Primers, 1 μl of RNase Inhibitor at 37 °C for 120 min. The cDNA was amplified in reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) using PCR gold buffer, also containing 2 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 0.8 mM dNTP mix, 0.001 mM forward and reverse primers and 1 U μl<sup>−1</sup> Amplitaq Gold (Applied Biosystems). The protocol used for PCR amplification was the following: denaturation at 95 °C for 30 s, annealing at 57 °C for 30 s, and elongation at 72 °C for 30 s (40 cycles). To test the ability of the K<sub>V</sub>7 primers to specifically recognize the mRNA target for which they were designed, RT-PCR experiments were performed with use of cDNA templates from adult rat brain (K<sub>V</sub>7.2–7.5) and heart (K<sub>V</sub>7.1) mRNAs.</p>
        <p>Real-time quantitative PCR (qPCR) was carried out by a 7500 fast real-time PCR system (Applied Biosystems) with primers specific for the K<sub>V</sub>7 channel genes and SYBR Green detection. Samples were amplified simultaneously in a triplicate in one-assay run and the cycle threshold (ct) value for each experimental group was determined. Data normalization was performed by using the ct for the amplification of GAPDH gene, a constitutively expressed gene, as a control. Differences in mRNA content between groups were calculated as normalized values by use of the 2<sup>−Δct</sup> formula.</p>

        <p>The rat gastric fundus was fixed in cold paraformaldehyde for 2 h at 4 °C. The preparations were then washed several times in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and incubated in sucrose 10%-PBS at 4 °C for cryopreservation. Tissue was subsequently embedded in Tissue-tek OCT compound and frozen at −80 °C. Frozen sections (20 μm) were cut using a cryostat, collected on super-frost glasses and stored at −20 °C for further processing. Slices were washed in PBS and incubated at 4 °C with the following primary antibodies: (i) rabbit anti K<sub>V</sub>7.1 (1:50, Alomone Labs, Jerusalem, Israel); (ii) rabbit anti K<sub>V</sub>7.4 (1:100, Abcam, Cambridge, UK); (iii) rabbit anti K<sub>V</sub>7.5 (1:100, Millipore, Temecula, CA, USA). Sections were washed three times in PBS for 10 min and subsequently incubated for 1 h at RT with an anti-rabbit conjugated to Cy3 (1:100, Jackson Immunoresearch, Suffolk, UK) and chromomycin A3 (1:1000, Sigma, St. Louis, MO, USA), used as a nuclear marker. All antibodies and chromomycin were diluted in PBS containing 10% FBS and 0.1% Triton X-100. Subsequently, sections were washed in PBS, allowed to air dry and then mounted in SlowFade Antifade (Invitrogen – Molecular Probes, Carlsbad, CA, USA) before coverslipping. Coverslips were analyzed using a Zeiss LSM 510 Meta argon/krypton laser scanning confocal microscope. Images were acquired using the multitrack system to avoid crosstalk among channels. The excitation/emission settings were 430/505–550 nm for chromomycin, and 543/560–615 nm for CY3. Images were confocally captured by use of 10X, 20X or 63X-oil immersion objective (PlanApochromat; numerical aperture 1.4), with a maximal confocal zoom factor of 3, fixed box sizes of 512 × 512 pixels, and pinhole below 1 Airy unit. Each image was acquired four times, and the signal was averaged to improve the signal to noise ratio. The colour scheme used was green for chromomycin A3, and red for Cy3-labelled structures.</p>

          <p>XE-991 (0.5–100 μM) produced concentration-dependent contractions of the gastric fundus strips (<xref rid="fig0005" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>A). The mean pD<sub>2</sub> and <italic>E</italic><sub>max</sub> of XE-991-induced concentration-response curve were 5.40 ± 0.06 and 64.0 ± 2.5% of U46619 (0.1 μM)-induced contraction, respectively (<italic>n</italic> = 13, <xref rid="fig0005" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>B). Retigabine, added to the bath medium at the top of XE-991-induced concentration–response curve, did not induce any effect up to 10 μM (<italic>n</italic> = 4). At the concentration of 30 μM, retigabine reverted XE-991-produced contraction by 13.1 ± 1.9% (<italic>n</italic> = 4).

Including this higher starting tone level remaining after XE-991 washout from the bath medium (i.e. measuring the contraction from the beginning of the concentration–response curve to XE-991), the contraction produced by the second addition of U46619 (0.1 μM) to the medium was 121.0 ± 1.8% of the first one (109.3 ± 3.8% vs. 88.3 ± 3.0%, <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.001).</p>

          <title>Motor effects of K<sub>V</sub>7 channel activators</title>
          <p>Since retigabine and flupirtine were dissolved with DMSO, the putative motor effects of this solvent were investigated. DMSO induced reversible relaxations of U46619-precontracted fundus strips. The relaxations produced by DMSO at the concentrations (0.33% and 1.44%) obtained in the bath medium when the effects of retigabine and flupirtine at the maximal concentrations tested (100 and 144 μM, respectively) were investigated were 7.4 ± 1.4% and 22.0 ± 2.7% (<italic>n</italic> = 4), respectively.</p>
          <p>Retigabine (1–100 μM) (<xref rid="fig0010" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>A) and flupirtine (4–144 μM) (<xref rid="fig0010" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>B) induced concentration-dependent relaxations of U46619-precontracted strips. Flupirtine-induced relaxations displayed a slower progression than those induced by retigabine (<xref rid="fig0010" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>A and B). In addition, since in preliminary experiments the strips did not recover to basal tone after flupirtine washout from the bath, the concentration-response relationship for the relaxant effects induced by flupirtine was studied by adding this drug cumulatively to the incubation medium. On the contrary, the strips fully recovered to basal tone after retigabine washout, so that isolated concentration–response curves were performed. The maximal amplitude of the relaxations induced by retigabine and flupirtine, calculated by non linear regression analysis of the concentration–response curves, were 93.6 ± 2.3% (<italic>n</italic> = 6) and 90.9 ± 2.1% (<italic>n</italic> = 6) of the maximal amplitude parameter, respectively (<xref rid="fig0010" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>C). Thus, the relaxant effects produced by retigabine and flupirtine were much higher than those produced by DMSO. The pD<sub>2</sub>s (−log EC<sub>50</sub>) of the concentration-response curves for the relaxations produced by retigabine and flupirtine and were 4.73 ± 0.05 and 4.41 ± 0.06, respectively (<xref rid="fig0010" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>C). The strips recovered to 93.1 ± 1.6% (<italic>n</italic> = 6), 91.1 ± 4.6% (<italic>n</italic> = 4) and 79.3 ± 0.5% (<italic>n</italic> = 2) of the maximal relaxation induced by flupirtine 10, 20 and 30 min after flupirtine washout from the bath, respectively (<xref rid="fig0010" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>B). XE-991 (20 μM) fully blocked retigabine (10 μM)-induced relaxant effects (<italic>n</italic> = 4) and almost abolished the relaxations induced by retigabine (30 μM) and flupirtine (44 μM) (7.0 ± 1.3%, <italic>n</italic> = 4, and 4.1 ± 2.0%, <italic>n</italic> = 4, respectively). Concentration-response experiments performed to better evaluate the inhibitory effects of XE-991 on retigabine-induced relaxation revealed that XE-991 (0.5–20 μM) concentration-dependently inhibited the relaxant response induced by retigabine (30 μM), with a pIC<sub>50</sub> and a maximal inhibitory effect of 6.22 ± 0.05 and 90.1 ± 2.0% of controls (<italic>n</italic> = 3), respectively (<xref rid="fig0015" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>). When re-evaluated 30 min after XE-991 (20 μM) washout from the bath, the relaxation produced by retigabine (30 μM) was 9.4 ± 1.0% of controls. Neither TTX (1 μM) nor CTX GVIA (30 nM) affected the <italic>E</italic><sub>max</sub> and the pD<sub>2</sub> of the flupirtine-induced concentration–response curve (86.3 ± 2.2% and 4.40 ± 0.02, <italic>n</italic> = 3, with TTX, respectively; 87.3 ± 0.3% and 4.47 ± 0.19, <italic>n</italic> = 3, with CTX GVIA, respectively). Similarly, the relaxations produced by retigabine (100 μM) were not modified by TTX (1 μM) or CTX GVIA (30 nM, <xref rid="fig0010" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>A) (103.6 ± 2.7%, <italic>n</italic> = 3, and 102.4 ± 3.0%, <italic>n</italic> = 3, of controls, respectively).</p>

Higher concentrations (20 and 50 μM) of XE-991 produced similar significant increases (<xref rid="fig0020" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref>A and B, left graph). XE-991 (10, 20 and 50 μM) significantly inhibited the amplitude of EFS (13 Hz)-evoked relaxation (by 13.9 ± 2.6%, <italic>n</italic> = 8, <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.001, 10.8 ± 2.5%, <italic>n</italic> = 8, <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.01, and 18.2 ± 1.3%, <italic>n</italic> = 9, <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.001, of controls, respectively; P = 0.071, one-way ANOVA, <xref rid="fig0020" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref>A and B, middle graph). XE-991 (10 μM) did not significantly affect the AUC of 13 Hz EFS-induced relaxation.

The increase in the amplitude of EFS (2 Hz)-evoked relaxation produced by DMP-543 (20 μM) was significantly greater than that observed with XE-991 (20 μM) (<italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.05, unpaired <italic>t</italic>-test). The amplitudes of relaxations evoked by EFS (2 Hz) without or with DMP-543 (20 μM) in the bath were 59.9 ± 2.3% and 74.4 ± 2.2%, <italic>n</italic> = 7, <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.001, respectively.

          <p>Since XE-991 and DMP-543 increased strip tone, control experiments were performed in which some strips were further contracted by a higher concentration (0.3 μM) of U46619 to evaluate whether the higher muscle tone level could affect the relaxant responses evoked by the second series of EFS (2 and 13 Hz). The higher muscle tone produced by U46619 (0.3 μM) (by 23.1 ± 4.6%, <italic>n</italic> = 6), however, did not significantly affect the relaxant responses induced by EFS (2 and 13 Hz).

However, when the amplitudes of EFS (2 Hz)-induced relaxations were measured from the point at which retigabine (3 μM) was added to the bath medium, they were not anymore significantly different from control relaxations (105.8 ± 2.9%). Retigabine (3 μM) did not significantly affect the amplitude of the relaxation induced by EFS (13 Hz) (101.6 ± 2.3% of controls).

          <p>The amplitudes of the relaxant effects produced by acidified NaNO<sub>2</sub> (300 μM), a tool used to study NO-induced effects, and VIP (10 nM) were 50.4 ± 2.2% and 89.3 ± 1.9% of the maximal amplitude parameter, respectively (<italic>n</italic> = 16). The AUC of VIP (10 nM)-evoked relaxant response, divided by the maximal amplitude parameter, was 15.0 ± 0.6 min.</p>
          <p>In the untreated strips that served for checking possible effects due to the time elapsed between the two series of consecutive incubations with acidified NaNO<sub>2</sub> (300 μM), a tool used to study NO-induced effects, and VIP (10 nM), the amplitude of the second acidified NaNO<sub>2</sub> (300 μM)-induced relaxation was not significantly different from that of the first one (90.9 ± 5.7%, <italic>n</italic> = 9, of controls; 48.3 ± 3.0% and 42.6 ± 1.8%, respectively, <xref rid="fig0025" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref>B, left graph). On the contrary, the amplitude and the AUC of the relaxant response induced by the second incubation with VIP (10 nM) were significantly different from those of the first one (96.2 ± 1.6%, <italic>n</italic> = 9, <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.05, and 89.8 ± 2.5%, <italic>n</italic> = 9, <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.01, of controls, respectively, <xref rid="fig0025" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref>B, middle and right graphs). XE-991 (20 μM) did not significantly affect the amplitude of the relaxation induced by acidified NaNO<sub>2</sub> (300 μM) (98.7 ± 5.4%, <italic>n</italic> = 7, of controls; 53.1 ± 3.1% and 52.2 ± 4.0%, respectively, <xref rid="fig0025" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref>A and B, left graph). However, XE-991 (20 μM) significantly reduced the amplitude and the AUC of the relaxant response produced by VIP (10 nM) (to 76.9 ± 1.7%, <italic>n</italic> = 7, <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.001, and 60.3 ± 3.6%, <italic>n</italic> = 7, <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.001, of controls; both <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.001 vs. time controls, unpaired Student's <italic>t</italic>-test, <xref rid="fig0025" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref>A and B, middle and right graphs). The amplitudes of relaxations evoked by VIP (10 nM) before and during incubation with XE-991 (20 μM) were 94.4 ± 3.0% and 72.5 ± 2.2%, <italic>n</italic> = 7, <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.001, respectively. The AUCs of the relaxant responses induced by VIP (10 nM) without and with XE-991 (20 μM) in the bath were 14.9 ± 1.0 min and 8.9 ± 0.5 min, <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.001, respectively. In this experimental series, the contraction produced by XE-991 (20 μM) was 19.5 ± 1.9%.</p>

        <title>Gene expression studies</title>
        <p>To evaluate the expression of the mRNAs encoding for the various subtypes of K<sub>V</sub>7 channels and estimate their relative expression levels in the rat gastric fundus, the total RNA isolated from the fundus was amplified in RT-PCR and real-time qPCR experiments using primers specifically designed to recognize all mRNA splicing variants from each K<sub>V</sub>7 channel gene (<xref rid="tbl0005" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). Transcripts from all known K<sub>V</sub>7 channel genes were detected in the rat gastric fundus by RT-PCR with 40 cycles (<xref rid="fig0030" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6</xref>A). However, it is well known that RT-PCR experiments with a high fixed number of cycles can only give qualitative results. Consequently, qPCR experiments were performed to quantify the relative expression levels of K<sub>V</sub>7 channel genes. K<sub>V</sub>7.4 and 7.5 channel subtypes showed the highest expression levels (<xref rid="fig0030" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6</xref>B). The mean cycle thresholds were 27.8, 28.3, 31.5, 32.4, and 34.5 for K<sub>V</sub>7.4, 7.5, 7.1, 7.3, and 7.2 channel cDNA, respectively. Relative to K<sub>V</sub>7.4, transcript levels of K<sub>V</sub>7.1, 7.2, 7.3 and 7.5 channel genes were approximately 8.1%, 1.7%, 5.2% and 58.4%, respectively. In addition to those listed in <xref rid="tbl0005" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>, at least one additional set of primer pairs was used to test the expression of each K<sub>V</sub>7 transcript, with results similar to those shown in <xref rid="fig0030" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6</xref>A (data not shown).</p>

        <title>Immunohistochemistry</title>
        <p>Since gene expression studies revealed that the transcript abundance for K<sub>V</sub>7.4 and K<sub>V</sub>7.5 appeared to be the highest among K<sub>V</sub>7 members, confocal immunofluorescence experiments were carried out using two polyclonal antibodies directed against K<sub>V</sub>7.4 and K<sub>V</sub>7.5 to gain insight into the cellular and subcellular localization of K<sub>V</sub>7.4 and K<sub>V</sub>7.5 proteins in the rat gastric fundus. The specificity of the antibodies against each target subunit was assessed in immunocytochemical experiments in CHO cells expressing K<sub>V</sub>7.4 or K<sub>V</sub>7.5 proteins (data not shown). In rat gastric fundus sections, both K<sub>V</sub>7.4 and K<sub>V</sub>7.5 antibodies showed a similar staining pattern, labelling both the epithelial and muscular compartments (<xref rid="fig0035" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7</xref>A). In the latter, both the circular (internal) and the longitudinal (external) layers appeared to be labelled. K<sub>V</sub>7.5 staining in the muscular layers appeared fainter than that observed in the epithelial layer. Moreover, in the muscular layers, K<sub>V</sub>7.4 staining appeared more intense when compared to that for K<sub>V</sub>7.5. For comparison, staining for K<sub>V</sub>7.1 was investigated and found to be predominantly, but not exclusively, localized to the epithelial compartment (data not shown). Higher magnification images for both K<sub>V</sub>7.4 and K<sub>V</sub>7.5 antibodies revealed that, in the muscular layers, these subunits were mainly localized to the plasma membrane of spindle-shaped smooth muscle cells, although we cannot exclude that part of the immunofluorescence signal also corresponds to neuronal fibres or ICC. No nuclear staining was revealed, as suggested by the lack of co-localization with the DNA-binding marker chromomycin A3 (<xref rid="fig0035" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7</xref>B). For both K<sub>V</sub>7.4 and K<sub>V</sub>7.5 antibodies, membrane staining in smooth muscle cells appeared non-continuous, rather showing puncta of higher expression density, possibly corresponding to regions of subunit clustering.</p>

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>Several K<sup>+</sup> channels are expressed in the SMC–ICC–FLC syncytial apparatus of the gastrointestinal tract. Functionally, the most important of them are the delayed rectifier K<sub>V</sub>1, 2 and 4 channels, large- and small-conductance K<sub>Ca</sub> (BK and SK) channels and ATP-dependent K<sub>ir</sub> (K<sub>ATP</sub>) channels <xref rid="bib0010 bib0115" ref-type="bibr">[2,23]</xref>. However, additional types of K<sup>+</sup> channels are present in the gastrointestinal SMC–ICC–FLC syncytial apparatus, including the delayed rectifier K<sub>V</sub>7 (KCNQ) channels <xref rid="bib0010" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>. These channels are mostly known for their involvement in the physiology of cardiomyocytes and neurons. The activation of K<sub>V</sub>7.1 channels produces slowly activating K<sup>+</sup> currents (<italic>I</italic><sub>Ks</sub>) that are responsible for the late repolarizing phase of the action potential in cardiomyocytes. On the other hand, <italic>I</italic><sub>KM</sub> mediated by K<sub>V</sub>7.2, 7.3 and 7.5 channels regulates resting membrane potential, firing rate and neurotransmitter release in sympathetic <xref rid="bib0095" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>, sensory <xref rid="bib0025" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref> and central <xref rid="bib0120 bib0125 bib0130" ref-type="bibr">[24–26]</xref> neurons. Studies on K<sub>V</sub>7 channels in the smooth muscle were mainly carried out in blood vessels. The first gene expression analysis of vascular K<sub>V</sub>7 channels was carried out by Ohya et al. <xref rid="bib0135" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref> in murine portal vein. An extensive profiling of K<sub>V</sub>7 channel gene expression throughout the murine vasculature followed a few years later <xref rid="bib0140" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref>. Recently, K<sub>V</sub>7 channel gene expression has been also shown in human arteries <xref rid="bib0145" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref>. Many studies evaluated the electrophysiological and functional effects of K<sub>V</sub>7 channel modulators on blood vessels. Retigabine and flupirtine activate K<sup>+</sup> currents in myocytes of murine portal vein <xref rid="bib0150" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref> and rat pulmonary artery <xref rid="bib0155" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref> and retigabine-induced effects are prevented by pretreatment with XE991 <xref rid="bib0150" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref>. Retigabine and flupirtine relax precontracted segments of various mouse blood vessels <xref rid="bib0140 bib0160" ref-type="bibr">[28,32]</xref> and their effects are blocked by XE-991 <xref rid="bib0140" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref>. Retigabine and S-1, another K<sub>V</sub>7 channel activator, relax precontracted human arteries and their effects are reversed by XE-991 <xref rid="bib0145" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref>. XE-991 and linopirdine, another non-selective K<sub>V</sub>7 channel blocker, induce significant increases in spontaneous contractile activity in the mouse portal vein <xref rid="bib0165" ref-type="bibr">[33]</xref> and vasoconstriction of different <italic>in vitro</italic> preparations of rat <xref rid="bib0155 bib0170 bib0175 bib0180" ref-type="bibr">[31,34–36]</xref>, mouse <xref rid="bib0140 bib0170" ref-type="bibr">[28,34]</xref> and human <xref rid="bib0145" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref> blood vessels. Only a few studies are available on other smooth muscles. K<sub>V</sub>7 channel activators or blockers reduce or increase the motor activity of rat urinary bladder <xref rid="bib0055" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref> and mouse and human myometrium, respectively <xref rid="bib0050 bib0185" ref-type="bibr">[10,37]</xref>. In addition, evidence has been provided that guinea-pig bladder ICC have outward voltage-dependent K<sup>+</sup> currents inhibited by XE-991 with a role in the regulation of resting membrane potential and excitability <xref rid="bib0190" ref-type="bibr">[38]</xref>. As for the gastrointestinal smooth muscle, K<sub>V</sub>7 channel activators or blockers induce inhibitory or excitatory effects on colonic spontaneous motor activity, respectively <xref rid="bib0045" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>. In addition, <italic>I</italic><sub>Ks</sub> currents have been detected in gastric antrum SMC <xref rid="bib0070" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>. In the present study, the effects of K<sub>V</sub>7 channel modulators on muscle tone and relaxant responses elicited by EFS, NO and VIP were evaluated in the rat gastric fundus. Expression of the transcripts and subunits encoded by the different K<sub>V</sub>7 genes has been also investigated in this tissue by qPCR and immunohystochemistry, respectively.</p>
      <p>At first, the effects of the selective K<sub>V</sub>7 channel blocker XE-991 <xref rid="bib0095" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref> on non-precontracted strips of the rat gastric fundus were investigated. XE-991 concentration-dependently contracted the fundus strips with a mean EC<sub>50</sub> of approximately 4.6 μM. It has been shown that IC<sub>50</sub> values of XE-991 for K<sub>V</sub>7.1–7.4 and K<sub>V</sub>7.5 channels are approximately 1–5 μM and 60 μM, respectively, and the actions of this blocker appear to be selective for K<sub>V</sub>7 channels at these concentrations <xref rid="bib0040" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>. Thus, the EC<sub>50</sub> of XE-991 in the rat gastric fundus is in the low micromolar range at which this blocker has been shown to inhibit K<sub>V</sub>7.1–7.4 channels. The mean <italic>E</italic><sub>max</sub> of XE-991 was 63.2% of the maximal amplitude parameter. Considering that this latter value is similar to that observed with 0.1 μM U46619 (75.8% of the maximal U46619-induced contraction), the maximal effect of XE-991 was approximately 47.9% (63.2% of 75.8%) of the strip maximal contractile potential. XE-991 and DMP-543 also further contracted U46619-precontracted strips by approximately 24% of the maximal amplitude parameter (i.e., approximately 18.2% of the strip maximal contractile potential). Thus, when the muscle is contracted to approximately three quarters of the maximum, XE-991 can still induce a contraction of approximately 38% of that induced when the smooth muscle is relaxed. XE-991-induced contraction was not affected by TTX or CTX GVIA, indicating that it is not produced by neuronal activation or excitatory neurotransmitter release from neuronal terminals. Thus, XE-991 acts very probably at the level of the SMC–ICC–FLC syncytial apparatus. Hypothesizing that XE-991 is acting only on K<sub>V</sub>7 channels, these findings suggest that, in the SMC–ICC–FLC syncytial apparatus of proximal stomach, a fraction of K<sub>V</sub>7 channels is in the open state at the membrane resting potential and plays a crucial role in determining the low level of basal muscle tone. This fraction would be higher in strips precontracted to submaximal levels, due to membrane depolarization.</p>
      <p>The selective K<sub>V</sub>7.2–7.5 channel activators retigabine and flupirtine <xref rid="bib0020 bib0100" ref-type="bibr">[4,20]</xref> produced concentration-dependent relaxations of precontracted fundus strips with EC<sub>50</sub> of approximately 19 μM and 40 μM, respectively. Retigabine- and flupirtine-induced relaxations were inhibited in a concentration-dependent manner by XE-991 and were not affected by TTX or CTX GVIA. Thus, they relax the gastric fundus very probably by specifically activating K<sub>V</sub>7 channels located in the SMC–ICC–FLC syncytial apparatus and not by mechanisms involving non-specific neuronal effects, such as activation of inhibitory motor neurons or neurotransmitter release from their terminals. Retigabine and flupirtine almost completely relaxed the strips, indicating a very significant contribution of K<sub>V</sub>7 channels in regulating gastric smooth muscle contractility. XE-991-induced contractions and flupirtine-induced relaxations reversed very slowly, leading to a only partial recovery upon their washout from the bath. These results possibly suggest a slow dissociation rate for these drugs from the channels, which would thus remain stabilized in the closed or the open state, respectively, by the two K<sub>V</sub>7 channel modulators. Retigabine, on the other hand, displayed faster kinetics and its effects were entirely reversed.</p>
      <p>The partial reversibility or irreversibility of XE-991-induced effects has been reported in a number of previous studies <xref rid="bib0165 bib0195" ref-type="bibr">[33,39]</xref>. It is also known that the specific effects of XE-991 on K<sub>V</sub>7 channels are likely to be maximal at concentrations of 10–20 μM and, when XE-991 concentration is increased above these values, the drug is no longer selective for K<sub>V</sub>7 channels <xref rid="bib0040 bib0180 bib0195 bib0200" ref-type="bibr">[8,36,39,40]</xref>. Thus, as far as XE-991 is concerned, the following alternative hypothesis may be put forward: on washout of 100 μM XE-991, the recovery to approximately 53% of its maximal contraction may represent reversal of the non-specific effects (and perhaps part of specific effects), with the remaining sustained contraction reflecting its irreversible action on K<sub>V</sub>7 channels. This hypothesis may be supported by the observation that, 30 min after XE-991 washout from the bath, the relaxant effect of retigabine was still almost fully blocked. In addition, the fact that application of U46619 (0.1 μM) after treatment with XE-991 induced a contraction significantly higher than that produced before XE-991 treatment, is also consistent with this hypothesis. In fact, U46619, when applied for the second time at submaximal concentrations, would be acting on a membrane partially depolarized by the XE-991-produced irreversible K<sub>V</sub>7 channel blockade. XE-991 was approximately as potent in contracting the rat gastric fundus as in inhibiting the voltage-dependent outward K<sup>+</sup> currents in mouse portal vein SMC <xref rid="bib0165" ref-type="bibr">[33]</xref> and enhancing the depolarization-evoked [<sup>3</sup>H]dopamine release from rat striatal synaptosomes <xref rid="bib0125" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>. XE-991 blocks cloned K<sub>V</sub>7.2, 7.2/7.3, 7.4 and 7.5 channels expressed in <italic>Xenopus</italic> oocytes, Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) or human embryo kidney (HEK) cells with IC<sub>50</sub> of 0.7 μM <xref rid="bib0095" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>, 0.6 μM <xref rid="bib0095" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>, 5.5 μM <xref rid="bib0205" ref-type="bibr">[41]</xref> and 65–75 μM <xref rid="bib0210 bib0215" ref-type="bibr">[42,43]</xref>, respectively. Thus, XE-991 EC<sub>50</sub> for contracting the rat gastric fundus is very close to its IC<sub>50</sub> on cloned K<sub>V</sub>7.4 channels. Retigabine and flupirtine relax the rat gastric fundus with potencies similar to those found in precontracted rings of rat pulmonary artery (EC<sub>50</sub>s: 13 μM and 62 μM, respectively) <xref rid="bib0155" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref>. Retigabine activates cloned K<sub>V</sub>7.2, 7.3, 7.2/7.3, 7.4, 7.5 and 7.5/7.3 channels expressed in either <italic>Xenopus</italic> oocytes, CHO or HEK cells with EC<sub>50</sub> of 2.5 μM <xref rid="bib0220" ref-type="bibr">[44]</xref>, 0.6 μM <xref rid="bib0220" ref-type="bibr">[44]</xref>, 1.6 μM <xref rid="bib0225" ref-type="bibr">[45]</xref>, 1.4–5.2 μM <xref rid="bib0220 bib0230" ref-type="bibr">[44,46]</xref>, 2–6.4 μM <xref rid="bib0235" ref-type="bibr">[47]</xref> and 1.4 μM <xref rid="bib0240" ref-type="bibr">[48]</xref>, respectively. So, retigabine EC<sub>50</sub> for relaxing the rat gastric fundus appears closer to its EC<sub>50</sub>s for activating cloned K<sub>V</sub>7.4 or 7.5 channels than to those for activating K<sub>V</sub>7.2 or 7.3 channel subtypes. In our study, gene expression experiments showed that K<sub>V</sub>7.4 and 7.5 channel genes have the highest expression levels. Compared to the expression level of K<sub>V</sub>7.4 channel gene, that of K<sub>V</sub>7.5 channel gene was approximately 60%, whereas those of K<sub>V</sub>7.1, 7.2 and 7.3 channel genes resulted lower than 10%. A similar scenario has been described in blood vessels <xref rid="bib0040" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref> and mouse stomach <xref rid="bib0045" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>. Very low levels of K<sub>V</sub>7.1–7.3 channel mRNAs have been detected in the rat gastric fundus also by Ohya et al. <xref rid="bib0070" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>. Immunohistochemical studies carried out by confocal immunofluorescence methods showed that K<sub>V</sub>7.4 and 7.5 channels are localized within the epithelial and muscular layers of the rat proximal stomach. In the muscular layers, both channel subtypes appeared to be mainly localized to the plasma membrane of spindle-shaped smooth muscle cells and the staining for K<sub>V</sub>7.4 channels appeared more intense when compared to that for K<sub>V</sub>7.5 channels. Although the present results cannot exclude that part of the immunofluorescence signal within the muscular layers also corresponds to neuronal fibres or ICCs, the fact that TTX or CTX GVIA did not interfere with the effects of XE-991 and retigabine suggests that K<sub>V</sub>7 channel activators and blockers exert their direct motor effects in the rat gastric fundus by acting preferentially on muscle K<sub>V</sub>7.4 channels.</p>
      <p>XE-991 and DMP-543 produced small but significant increases in the relaxation induced by low-frequency neuronal activation. On the contrary, retigabine, at a concentration (3 μM) that induced a very small relaxation (approximately 11–13% of the maximal parameter), significantly reduced low-frequency EFS-evoked relaxation. These findings seem to suggest that K<sub>V</sub>7 channels, in addition to their effects on SMC contractility, may also be involved in the repolarization mechanisms of the inhibitory motor neurons responsible for this relaxation, that are mainly nitrergic neurons. We could hypothesize that K<sub>V</sub>7 channel blockade would delay membrane repolarization, thus increasing the duration of the action potential and consequently neurotransmitter release. However, in the absence of any direct measurement of neuronal action potential, we must acknowledge the speculative nature of the proposed mechanism. On the contrary, XE-991 and DMP-543 significantly reduced the relaxation induced by high-frequency EFS. Such an effect could be generated by pre- or post-junctional actions. To clarify that, the effects of XE-991 were also evaluated on the relaxation induced by the main neurotransmitter responsible for the long duration of high-frequency EFS-induced proximal stomach relaxation, i.e. VIP. XE-991 also reduced VIP-induced relaxation, but did not affect the relaxation induced by NO. These results seem to suggest that K<sub>V</sub>7 channel activation is a signal transduction mechanism of VIP in the SMC of the proximal stomach and the inhibitory effect of XE-991 on the relaxation evoked by high-frequency EFS can be attributed to the blockade of K<sub>V</sub>7 channel activation by VIP released from the inhibitory motor neurons. VIP relaxes the rat gastric fundus by activating VPAC2 receptors <xref rid="bib0245" ref-type="bibr">[49]</xref>. It is well known that the main signal transduction mechanism of VPAC2 receptors is the activation of adenylate cyclase through G<sub>s</sub> proteins <xref rid="bib0250" ref-type="bibr">[50]</xref>. The increase in intracellular cAMP levels and the consequent activation of protein kinase A (PKA), in turn, might activate K<sub>V</sub>7 channels. This hypothesis is supported by the fact that <italic>I</italic><sub>Ks</sub> or <italic>I</italic><sub>KM</sub> activation by β-adrenergic receptor agonists, cAMP analogs or PKA has been shown in cardiomyocytes and SMC <xref rid="bib0255 bib0260 bib0265" ref-type="bibr">[51–53]</xref>.</p>

      <title>Conclusions</title>
      <p>Our results seem to indicate that the pharmacological modulation of K<sub>V</sub>7 channels affects the motility of the rat gastric fundus, with K<sub>V</sub>7 channels activators evoking significant relaxation, and K<sub>V</sub>7 channel inhibitors increasing gastric tone in resting conditions. Moreover, K<sub>V</sub>7 channels also appear to play important roles as mediators of VIP-induced relaxation of the rat gastric fundus, and to participate to the repolarization of the inhibitory motor neurons responsible for the gastric relaxation evoked by low-frequency neuronal activation. Altogether, the results obtained provide the first functional demonstration of a critical control exerted by K<sub>V</sub>7 channels over rat proximal stomach motor activity, thus revealing a novel pharmacological target for therapeutic interventions against gastric motor disturbances.</p>

(A) Representative tracings showing the effects of XE-991 (20 μM). The submaximal relaxation amplitudes induced by EFS (2 Hz) were expressed as percentages of a maximal amplitude parameter measured from the maximal U46619-induced contraction point reached before the addition of any test substance to the maximal papaverine (300 μM)-induced relaxation point reached at the end of each experiment (parameter indicated with <bold>a</bold> in the panel). Similarly, the submaximal AUCs (mm min) of the relaxant responses induced by EFS (13 Hz) were divided by this same maximal amplitude parameter (mm) and expressed as min. On the contrary, each maximal relaxation amplitude induced by EFS (13 Hz) was expressed as a percentage of its own maximal amplitude parameter, measured from the U46619-induced contraction point reached at the start of each EFS-induced relaxation to the maximal papaverine (300 μM)-induced relaxation point reached at the end of each experiment (parameters indicated with <bold>b</bold> and <bold>c</bold> in the panel, respectively).

Each point represents the mean ± s.e.m. of responses observed in eight (0, 10 and 20 μM XE-991) or nine (50 μM XE-991) strips.
