        <title>Summary</title>
        <p>Long double-stranded RNAs (dsRNAs) may undergo extensive modification (hyperediting) by adenosine deaminases that act on RNA (ADARs), where up to 50% of adenosine (A) residues are changed to inosine (I). Traditionally, consequences of A-to-I editing were thought to be limited to modified RNA itself. We show here, however, that hyperedited dsRNA (I-dsRNA) is able to downregulate gene expression in <italic>trans</italic>. Furthermore, we show that both endogenous expression and reporter gene expression were substantially reduced in the presence of I-dsRNA. This was due to a reduction in reporter mRNA levels and also translation inhibition. Importantly, we show that I-dsRNA interferes with translation initiation. We also show that I-dsRNA specifically binds a stress-granule-like complex. Stress granules (SGs) are important for translational silencing during stress. Finally, we propose a model whereby editing by ADARs results in downregulation of gene expression via SG formation.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>Long double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) in cells is often indicative of viral infection (<xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr">Maquat and Carmichael, 2001</xref>). Alternatively, it may result from expression of both sense and antisense RNAs, or from the presence of inverted repeat sequences within noncoding RNA. Cells respond to long dsRNA molecules by activating general antiviral systems mediated by enzymes such as PKR (<xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr">Samuel, 1998</xref>). Alternatively, dsRNA may undergo covalent modification (editing) by adenosine deaminases that act on RNA (ADARs) (<xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr">Bass, 2002</xref>), or be used in the RNAi pathway (<xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">Filipowicz et al., 2005</xref>).</p>
      <p>ADARs catalyze the hydrolytic deamination of adenosine (A) to inosine (I) (<xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr">Bass, 2002</xref>). As I is decoded as guanosine (G) by ribosomes, selective editing has the potential to alter the coding capacity of mRNAs. ADARs also catalyze hyperediting within relatively long dsRNAs, where up to 50% of A residues are converted to I. Hyperediting changes not only the RNA sequence but also the structure, as IU and UI pairs have different geometry than AU and UA pairs (<xref rid="bib22" ref-type="bibr">Serra et al., 2004</xref>). Localized distortions within the RNA helix are likely to result from the presence of IU pairs.</p>
      <p>The majority of mammalian editing occurs within noncoding regions of RNA, such as inverted repeat sequences within intronic or intergenic RNAs, or within untranslated regions (UTRs). The most frequent targets of editing are high copy number repetitive elements, such as Alus (<xref rid="bib3 bib14 bib17" ref-type="bibr">Blow et al., 2004; Levanon et al., 2004; Morse et al., 2002</xref>). It has therefore been predicted that &gt;85% of pre-mRNAs may be edited. A-to-I editing has also been found within miRNA precursors, which has the potential to affect both miRNA production and also target recognition (<xref rid="bib4 bib10 bib24" ref-type="bibr">Blow et al., 2006; Kawahara et al., 2007; Yang et al., 2006</xref>).</p>
      <p>Hyperedited dsRNAs (I-dsRNAs) in cells may be subject to different fates. I-dsRNA may be retained in the nucleus by a protein complex comprising p54<sup>nrb</sup>, PSF, and matrin 3 (<xref rid="bib25" ref-type="bibr">Zhang and Carmichael, 2001</xref>). Alternatively, hyperediting by ADARs could provide a means of covalently “tagging” dsRNA for subsequent disposal. We have previously identified a nuclease activity in various cytoplasmic extracts that specifically targets I-dsRNA (<xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr">Scadden and Smith, 2001</xref>). Cleavage occurred within sequences containing multiple IU pairs, but not in duplexes that contained either isosteric GU pairs or Watson-Crick base pairs. Tudor staphylococcal nuclease (TSN), which is a component of the RNA-induced silencing complex in the RNAi pathway (<xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">Filipowicz et al., 2005</xref>), is important for cleavage of I-dsRNA (<xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr">Scadden, 2005</xref>). Cleavage of I-dsRNA may play a role in viral defense or in destroying cellular dsRNAs edited by ADARs.</p>
      <p>During stress, eukaryotic cells have the ability to reprogram their ribosomes to selectively synthesize proteins needed for survival (<xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr">Anderson and Kedersha, 2006</xref>). As part of this process, a subset of cellular mRNAs are translationally silenced by sequestration into cytoplasmic stress granules (SGs). As the mechanism underlying SG assembly appears to be impaired translation initiation (<xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr">Anderson and Kedersha, 2006</xref>), SGs comprise stalled initiation complexes and small ribosomal proteins (<xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr">Kedersha et al., 2002</xref>). When stress conditions are relieved, sequestered mRNAs may reassemble on polysomes to resume translation (<xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr">Kedersha et al., 2000</xref>). Alternatively, mRNAs may be destroyed in cytoplasmic processing bodies (P bodies), which are dynamically linked to SGs (<xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr">Kedersha et al., 2005</xref>). SGs therefore comprise sites of triage where mRNAs are sorted for storage, reinitiation, or degradation.</p>
      <p>Here we demonstrate that I-dsRNA specifically binds a complex that comprises proteins previously characterized as SG components. Furthermore, we show that I-dsRNA in cells results in downregulating both endogenous and reporter gene expression, in <italic>trans</italic>. We provide evidence that this is the result of both reduced mRNA levels and impaired translation. Moreover, we show that I-dsRNA inhibits translation initiation. We therefore propose a model in which hyperediting of dsRNAs by ADARs results in downregulation of gene expression via SG formation.</p>

        <title>I-dsRNA Binding Proteins</title>
        <p>dsRNA affinity matrices were previously used to identify specific I-dsRNA binding proteins, such as TSN (<xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr">Scadden, 2005</xref>). We have now used a similar approach to identify additional I-dsRNA binding proteins. Briefly, <italic>X. laevis</italic> oocyte extract was incubated with a GU dsRNA affinity matrix to deplete nonspecific proteins, then with either a specific I-dsRNA (IU; <xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>) affinity matrix or a second GU dsRNA matrix (see <xref rid="app2" ref-type="sec">Figure S1</xref> in the <xref rid="app2" ref-type="sec">Supplemental Data</xref> available with this article online). 2D-Dige was used to analyze proteins eluted from the final GU and IU matrices (<xref rid="app2" ref-type="sec">Figure S1</xref>B), and I-dsRNA binding proteins were subsequently identified. Interestingly, most of these proteins were SG components (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>A and <xref rid="app2" ref-type="sec">Table S1</xref>). Where antibodies were available, immunoblots were used to confirm that the <italic>X. laevis</italic> proteins identified did bind specifically to I-dsRNA (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>B). Immunoblotting was also used to demonstrate the presence of an additional SG component, HuR, that was not identified by protein sequencing (<xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr">Anderson and Kedersha, 2006</xref>).</p>
        <p>We next asked whether the specificity of binding of the <italic>X. laevis</italic> proteins to I-dsRNA was maintained in HeLa cell lysates. Specific (IU) or nonspecific (GU, C) dsRNAs were therefore used for HeLa cell affinity purification. Immunoblots were subsequently used to demonstrate that the I-dsRNA stress-complex proteins identified in <italic>X. laevis</italic> also bound preferentially to I-dsRNA in HeLa cell lysates (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>C, lanes 4–6). Furthermore, immunoprecipitations (IP) using a TSN antibody in HeLa lysates showed that some of the proteins were found in an RNA-independent complex (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>D). It was not possible to look at all possible proteins due to a lack of suitable antibodies.</p>
        <p>Formation of an HeLa protein complex on I-dsRNA could additionally be shown using electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSA) (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>E). When IU dsRNA was incubated with HeLa lysate, an RNA-protein complex with retarded mobility (“Shift”) was observed (lanes 3–5). Moreover, a band with increased mobility that corresponds to cleavage of I-dsRNA (<xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr">Scadden, 2005</xref>) was also present (lanes 3–5). A similar shifted RNA-protein complex was also seen when GU dsRNA was incubated with HeLa lysate (lanes 6–8). This was in contrast to <italic>X. laevis</italic> oocyte extract where RNA-protein complex formation using GU dsRNA was undetectable (<xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr">Scadden, 2005</xref>). Minor differences in the composition of the complex in <italic>X. laevis</italic> and HeLa may account for the observed difference in binding. Nevertheless, complex formation on GU dsRNA was less efficient than with IU dsRNA, as the IU dsRNA-protein complex was rapidly turned over due to cleavage (<xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr">Scadden, 2005</xref>). To confirm that the SG protein G3BP was present in the dsRNA-protein complex, a G3BP antibody was added to the assay with either IU or GU dsRNA. This gave rise to a “super-shifted” (SS) complex (lanes 4 and 7) that did not form when either antibody buffer (AB) or preimmune serum (PI) were added (lanes 3 and 6 and lanes 5 and 8, respectively). A similar analysis was used to confirm the presence of TSN in the dsRNA-protein complex (<xref rid="app2" ref-type="sec">Figure S2</xref>). These data provided independent evidence that both G3BP and TSN were components of the I-dsRNA complex.</p>

        <title>I-dsRNA Reduced Expression of Luciferase Reporters</title>
        <p>As the I-dsRNA complex comprised SG proteins, we speculated that the presence of I-dsRNA in cells could induce SG formation, which would result in downregulating mRNA expression. To test this hypothesis, reporter plasmids and various synthetic dsRNAs (<xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>) were used to cotransfect HeLa cells. Short dsRNAs were used to avoid activation of PKR. Transfection conditions favored efficient uptake of the dsRNAs (&gt;95% of cells), as judged by visualization of fluorescently labeled duplexes (data not shown).</p>
        <p>The first reporters tested were firefly (<italic>Pp</italic>-luc) and renilla luciferase (<italic>Rr</italic>-luc), together with the GP or IU dsRNAs (<xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). The GP and IU duplexes were identical except for the four central base pairs; the GP control dsRNA consisted of perfect Watson-Crick base pairs, while the IU dsRNA contained IU pairs. The <italic>Pp</italic>-luc and <italic>Rr</italic>-luc reporters shared no sequence homology with each other, or with the dsRNAs. The reporter plasmids were cotransfected with either IU or GP into HeLa cells, and luciferase (luc) assays were carried out after 30 hr. In the presence of IU dsRNA, expression of both <italic>Pp</italic>-luc and <italic>Rr</italic>-luc was substantially reduced relative to that in the presence of GP (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>A). This observation was also true when cells were harvested after 12–72 hr, and when the amount of specific dsRNA added was reduced 4-fold (data not shown). To ensure that the observed effect was unrelated to the sequence of the dsRNA per se, a second pair of dsRNAs, C and C-IU, were tested in the assay using luc reporters (<xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). Again, cotransfection of C-IU I-dsRNA with both luc reporters caused a substantial reduction in their expression relative to that with the control (C) dsRNA (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>B). Finally, a third pair of dsRNAs whose sequence corresponded to a miRNA duplex were tested for their effect on expression of the luc reporters. It was previously shown that the miR-142 pri-miRNA precursor was edited by ADARs both in vitro and in vivo (<xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr">Yang et al., 2006</xref>). Editing gave rise to numerous I residues in the sequences corresponding to both sense and antisense miRNAs, although the level of mature miRNAs was reduced due to inefficient processing (<xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr">Yang et al., 2006</xref>). Nevertheless, a pair of dsRNAs that mimicked either unedited miR-142 (miR-142) or edited miR-142 (miR-142-IU) were tested (<xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). Again, in the presence of the I-dsRNA, miR-142-IU, expression of <italic>Pp</italic>-luc and <italic>Rr</italic>-luc was reduced relative to that with unedited miR-142 (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>C).</p>
        <p>These data demonstrated conclusively that I-dsRNA was able to downregulate gene expression in a sequence-independent manner. Of particular interest was the observation that miR-142-IU caused reduced gene expression, which suggests that edited miRNAs have the potential for regulating gene expression in <italic>trans</italic>.</p>

      <sec id="sec2.3">
        <title>IU Pairs Are Necessary for Reduced Expression</title>
        <p>To test whether IU pairs were required to reduce reporter expression or if I was sufficient per se, the IC dsRNA (<xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>) was tested in parallel with IU and GP, in conjunction with the luc reporters. IC differed from IU in that it contained IC pairs in the central region. When luc assays were performed following transfection of the various duplexes, only the IU duplex reduced <italic>Pp</italic>-luc and <italic>Rr</italic>-luc expression (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>D). IU pairs were therefore necessary for inhibiting reporter expression. The GU duplex, which contains isosteric GU pairs rather than IU pairs (<xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>), was also tested. Cotransfection of GU dsRNA with the luc reporters resulted in a substantial reduction in their expression, relative to that with GP, although it was ∼2-fold less potent than the IU duplex (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>D). This observation was consistent with differential complex formation on IU and GU dsRNAs (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>). It is possible that the distortion in the RNA helix resulting from inclusion of either IU or GU pairs is important for recognition of proteins, ultimately resulting in reduced gene expression. When a duplex containing six IU pairs (6I; <xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>) was cotransfected with the luc reporters, it was more effective than IU dsRNA at inhibiting expression (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>D). Conversely, duplexes that contained only two IU pairs were ineffective at reducing reporter expression (data not shown). I-containing ssRNA was also unable to inhibit gene expression (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>E). These data suggested that only dsRNAs containing multiple IU or GU pairs were able to efficiently inhibit gene expression.</p>
      </sec>
      <sec id="sec2.4">
        <title>Expression of GU Duplexes In Vivo Reduced Gene Expression</title>
        <p>We next asked whether dsRNAs transcribed within the cell rather than by transfection were also able to reduce reporter gene expression. Plasmids based on pSuper, which was designed for use in RNAi, were therefore constructed in order to produce dsRNAs equivalent to either C or C-IU in vivo. However, as both GU and IU dsRNAs inhibited luc expression (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>D), GU pairs were substituted for IU pairs in the C-IU duplex. The pSuper-C and pSuper-C-GU constructs gave rise to C<sup>S</sup> and C-GU<sup>S</sup> dsRNAs, respectively (<xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). As seen with the transfected dsRNAs, C-GU<sup>S</sup> dsRNA resulted in substantially reduced expression of both luc reporters, relative to that with C<sup>S</sup> (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>F). These data confirmed that gene expression was reduced by dsRNAs containing multiple IU or GU pairs, irrespective of how they were introduced into cells.</p>
      </sec>
      <sec id="sec2.5">
        <title>I-dsRNA Reduced Expression of GFP and β-Globin Reporters</title>
        <p>The expression of two additional reporters (GFP and β-globin) was next examined, in conjunction with two pairs of dsRNAs (C and C-IU, GP and IU). Again, the reporters and dsRNAs were unrelated. Gene expression was analyzed by immunoblotting. With the C and C-IU duplexes, expression of both GFP and β-globin was substantially reduced in the presence of C-IU relative to C dsRNA (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>G, lanes 2 and 3, and <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>H, lanes 1 and 2, respectively). Similarly, expression of both GFP and β-globin was reduced in the presence of IU dsRNA compared with GP (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>G, lanes 1 and 4, and <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>H, lanes 3 and 4, respectively). An actin antibody was used as a loading control. As a large pool of presynthesized actin exists in HeLa cells, we assumed the levels would be unaffected by I-dsRNA. These data again demonstrate that I-dsRNA had a substantial effect on gene expression, in a sequence-independent manner.</p>
      </sec>
      <sec id="sec2.6">
        <title>I-dsRNA Reduced Endogenous Protein Synthesis</title>
        <p>We have shown conclusively that I-dsRNAs reduced expression of various reporter genes. We next asked whether I-dsRNA in cells also downregulated endogenous protein synthesis.</p>
        <p>To analyze the effect of I-dsRNA on endogenous protein synthesis, HeLa cells were transfected with either C or C-IU dsRNAs, then metabolically labeled with [<sup>35</sup>S]methionine ([<sup>35</sup>S]Met) 24 hr posttransfection. In the presence of the C-IU dsRNA, 20%–25% less [<sup>35</sup>S]Met was incorporated into newly synthesized endogenous proteins, relative to that seen with the control (C) duplex (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>I). An immunoblot of the cell lysates was probed with α-actin as a loading control (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>J). Analysis of the <sup>35</sup>S-labeled proteins by SDS-PAGE followed by phosphorimaging suggested that all detectable protein bands were less abundant (data not shown). These data clearly demonstrated that I-dsRNA was able to downregulate endogenous gene expression.</p>
      </sec>
      <sec id="sec2.7">
        <title>I-dsRNAs Reduce mRNA Levels</title>
        <p>I-dsRNA caused a substantial reduction in expression of four different reporters, relative to control dsRNAs. We subsequently carried out experiments to see whether I-dsRNA affected reporter mRNA levels.</p>
        <p>Reverse transcription (RT) and quantitative PCR (qPCR) were initially used to analyze <italic>Pp</italic>-luc mRNA levels in experiments in which luc reporters were cotransfected with three different pairs of dsRNAs (C and C-IU, GP and IU, and miR-142 and miR-142-IU). The amount of mRNA in the presence of I-dsRNA was calculated relative to that seen with the non-I-dsRNA control, and normalized to GAPDH. For each pair of dsRNAs, the reporter mRNA was reduced in the presence of I-dsRNA (C-IU, IU, miR-142-IU, <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>A). RNA from transfections with the GFP reporter and two pairs of dsRNAs (C and C-IU, GP and IU) was next analyzed. Again, the GFP mRNA was substantially reduced with C-IU and IU, relative to the control dsRNAs (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>B). The final reporter analyzed was β-globin mRNA, which differed from the other reporters in that it required splicing for subsequent expression. This was verified using standard RT-PCR (data not shown). RT/qPCR was again used to show that in the presence of two different I-dsRNAs, C-IU and IU, β-globin mRNA levels were reduced relative to those seen with either C or GP duplexes, respectively (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>C). These data together showed that I-dsRNA in cells resulted in a substantial reduction in reporter mRNA levels. Nuclear run on analyses suggested that this occurred posttranscriptionally (data not shown).</p>
      </sec>
      <sec id="sec2.8">
        <title>I-dsRNAs Cause Translational Inhibition</title>
        <p>While I-dsRNA caused a reduction in the level of reporter mRNAs (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>), this did not appear sufficient to wholly account for the substantial decrease in reporter gene expression (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figures 2</xref>A–2H). It was possible to estimate, at least for the luc reporters, that the reduction in gene expression in the presence of I-dsRNA was at least 2-fold greater than the fold-reduction in reporter mRNA levels. In keeping with the idea that I-dsRNA reduced gene expression via SG assembly, we therefore asked whether translation was also inhibited by I-dsRNA.</p>
        <p>To address this question, we analyzed translation of <italic>Pp</italic>-luc reporter mRNA in vitro using micrococcal nuclease (MN)-treated rabbit reticulocyte lysate (RRL), in the presence of C or C-IU dsRNAs. Luc assays were subsequently used to quantify translation efficiency, and the <italic>Pp</italic>-luc activity was expressed as a percentage of the luc activity in the absence of dsRNA. In translation reactions using RRL alone, increasing amounts of C and C-IU dsRNAs had no effect on translation of <italic>Pp</italic>-luc mRNA (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>A). However, when the RRL was supplemented with cytoplasmic HeLa extract (S100), translation of <italic>Pp</italic>-luc mRNA was reduced with increasing amounts of C-IU dsRNA (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>B). In contrast, addition of C dsRNA had a negligible effect on translation. It is possible that the requirement for S100 was due to the absence of TSN in RRL (<xref rid="app2" ref-type="sec">Figure S3</xref>A). This idea was supported by the observation that translation of <italic>Pp</italic>-luc mRNA in RRL supplemented with recombinant TSN (rTSN) was reduced in the presence of C-IU relative to that seen with C dsRNA (<xref rid="app2" ref-type="sec">Figure S3</xref>B). While rTSN was less effective than S100 in reducing expression of <italic>Pp</italic>-luc mRNA, this may be due to inefficient recruitment of rTSN to protein complexes in RRL, or perhaps because another protein component was also absent.</p>
        <p>The translation inhibition observed with increasing concentrations of C-IU dsRNA was not the result of decreased stability of <italic>Pp</italic>-luc mRNA, as determined by RT/qPCR (<xref rid="app2" ref-type="sec">Figure S4</xref>). These data demonstrated that I-dsRNA caused translational inhibition in vitro.</p>

        <title>I-dsRNA Reduced Translation of Endogenous mRNAs</title>
        <p>I-dsRNA inhibited translation of exogenous <italic>Pp</italic>-luc mRNA in vitro. We next asked whether translation of endogenous mRNAs in vitro was also reduced in the presence of C-IU dsRNA.</p>
        <p>We initially analyzed the effect of C-IU on translation of endogenous RRL globin mRNA. Translation reactions were therefore assembled using non-MN-treated RRL/S100, and [<sup>35</sup>S]Met was added to enable visualization of the translation products. In the presence of increasing concentrations of C-IU dsRNA, a corresponding decrease in translation of both <italic>Pp</italic>-luc and globin mRNA was seen (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>C, lanes 7–12, <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>D). Although the reduction of <italic>Pp</italic>-luc translation appeared less than observed previously (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>B), this was likely to be due to competition with other mRNAs in the non-MN-treated RRL. As expected, no decrease in translation was observed with increasing amounts of C dsRNA, for either <italic>Pp</italic>-luc or globin mRNAs (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>C, lanes 1–6, and <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>D).</p>
        <p>Translation of total HeLa mRNA was then analyzed using MN-treated RRL/S100, where [<sup>35</sup>S]Met was added to enable quantification. In the presence of increasing amounts of C-IU dsRNA, a corresponding decrease in translation of HeLa mRNA was observed, relative to that seen with C dsRNA (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>E). <sup>35</sup>S-labeled proteins generated by in vitro translation of HeLa mRNA were also visualized by SDS-PAGE. A decrease in the intensity of all detectable protein bands was seen with increasing amounts of C-IU dsRNA, relative to the control duplex (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>F, lanes 5–8 and lanes 1–4, respectively).</p>
        <p>These data showed that I-dsRNA had an inhibitory effect on protein synthesis in vitro and were consistent with the observation that I-dsRNA resulted in downregulating protein synthesis in vivo (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>I).</p>

        <title>I-dsRNA Inhibited Initiation of Translation</title>
        <p>We have shown that I-dsRNA inhibited translation of many mRNAs. We therefore considered whether I-dsRNA interfered with either translation initiation or elongation.</p>
        <p>To investigate the effect of I-dsRNA on translation initiation, several reporter mRNAs were used for translation that differed in their requirement for initiation factors. These reporters depended on viral internal ribosome entry sites (IRESs) for recognition of the start codon, rather than cap-dependent ribosome scanning. The additional reporters used were poliovirus-<italic>Pp</italic>-luc (PV-<italic>Pp</italic>-luc), classical swine fever virus-<italic>Pp</italic>-luc (CSFV-<italic>Pp</italic>-luc), and cricket paralysis virus-<italic>Pp</italic>-luc (CrPV-<italic>Pp</italic>-luc). PV-<italic>Pp</italic>-luc requires all canonical factors except eIF4E; CSFV-<italic>Pp</italic>-luc does not require eIF4E, eIF4G, eIF4A, eIF4B, eIF1, or eIF1A; and CrPV-<italic>Pp</italic>-luc requires no canonical initiation factors. All of the luc reporters were capped and polyadenylated and were translated using MN-treated RRL/S100. The translation efficiency was measured by luc assays, as described above.</p>
        <p>As expected, addition of increasing amounts of C-IU dsRNA resulted in a corresponding decrease in translation of <italic>Pp</italic>-luc mRNA, while C dsRNA had no effect (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>G). For PV-<italic>Pp</italic>-luc mRNA, translation was also inhibited with increasing amounts of C-IU dsRNA, relative to translation with C dsRNA. In contrast, the C-IU dsRNA did not inhibit translation of either CrPV-<italic>Pp</italic>-luc or CSFV-<italic>Pp</italic>-luc mRNAs. Moreover, translation was increased at higher concentrations of C-IU dsRNA relative to that with an equivalent amount of C dsRNA. This observation was particularly evident for the CrPV-<italic>Pp</italic>-luc mRNA. It is possible that at high C-IU concentrations sufficient initiation factors were titrated out by I-dsRNA complex formation (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>) so that CrPV-<italic>Pp</italic>-luc, which requires no canonical initiation factors, has a competitive advantage for translation. Equivalent results were obtained when the <italic>Pp</italic>-Luc or IRES-<italic>Pp</italic>-luc mRNAs, along with C or C-IU dsRNAs, were injected into <italic>X. laevis</italic> oocytes (data not shown). These data unequivocally demonstrate that I-dsRNA inhibits translation initiation. We therefore concluded that I-dsRNA caused a reduction in reporter gene expression by reducing mRNA levels and by interfering with translation initiation.</p>

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>To the best of our knowledge, the data presented here provide insights that suggest new roles for I-dsRNA. While the effects of A-to-I editing were previously thought to be restricted to the modified RNA itself, we now see that I-dsRNA is able to inhibit gene expression in <italic>trans</italic> (<xref rid="fig2 fig3 fig4" ref-type="fig">Figures 2–4</xref>). We have therefore proposed a model to account for our observations (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>H). Briefly, our model predicts that I-dsRNA is generated during stress as the result of editing by ADARs. I-dsRNA binds the “stress-complex,” which in turn induces gene silencing via SG assembly. The rationale for the proposed model is discussed here.</p>
      <p>During cellular stress, up to 50% of mRNAs may be translationally silenced by sequestration in SGs (<xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr">Anderson and Kedersha, 2006</xref>). Transiently transfected reporters may also be silenced by induction of SGs (<xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr">Kedersha et al., 2000</xref>). Our findings that both endogenous protein synthesis and reporter gene expression are reduced in the presence of I-dsRNA (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>) are therefore consistent with SG formation and selective silencing of mRNAs under stress conditions.</p>
      <p>A key determinant for SG assembly is impaired translation initiation (<xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr">Anderson and Kedersha, 2006</xref>). In view of the fact that I-dsRNA inhibits gene expression by interfering with translation initiation (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>), this is a plausible route by which I-dsRNA could induce SG assembly. Translation initiation is likely to be blocked by I-dsRNA due to sequestration of initiation factors in the I-dsRNA complex (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>A). It is also feasible that the I-dsRNA complex is sufficient to nucleate SG assembly, facilitated by proteins such as TIA-1 and G3BP (<xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr">Anderson and Kedersha, 2006</xref>). However, the data presented here favor the idea that I-dsRNA could give rise to SGs as the result of impaired translation initiation.</p>
      <p>I-dsRNA not only inhibits translation initiation but also results in reduced levels of reporter mRNAs (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>). As there is a close connection between mRNA processing events in SGs and P bodies (<xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr">Kedersha et al., 2005</xref>), we predict that mRNAs are degraded in P bodies. Moreover, a previous study showed that a transiently expressed GFP reporter gene was localized to both SGs and P bodies (<xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr">Kedersha et al., 2005</xref>). A combination of both translational silencing and mRNA degradation therefore appears to be responsible for reduced gene expression observed in the presence of I-dsRNA.</p>
      <p>We have used model dsRNAs to show that I-dsRNA and GU dsRNA can downregulate gene expression (<xref rid="fig2 fig4" ref-type="fig">Figures 2 and 4</xref>). It is therefore important to consider where such dsRNAs would occur naturally. While GU pairs commonly occur within RNA duplexes, they are generally only found in tandem (<xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr">Masquida and Westhof, 2000</xref>). By analogy with I-dsRNA, it is unlikely that two GU pairs are sufficient to downregulate gene expression. I-dsRNA is produced by A-to-I editing by ADARs (<xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr">Bass, 2002</xref>). As discussed above, common editing substrates include noncoding repetitive elements such as Alus, as well as miRNA precursors (<xref rid="bib3 bib4 bib14" ref-type="bibr">Blow et al., 2004, 2006; Levanon et al., 2004</xref>). dsRNA arising from viral infection may also be edited by cytoplasmic ADAR1. While the I-dsRNAs used in this study were relatively short compared to naturally occurring substrates, they constitute an effective model for edited dsRNA. It is therefore expected that cellular I-dsRNAs would also have the potential to inhibit gene expression. Regulation may be achieved by differential expression of editing targets during adverse conditions. In the case of viral infection, dsRNA would only be present during infection. Alternatively, ADAR itself may be regulated during stress.</p>
      <p>Cytoplasmic ADAR1 is induced by interferon (<xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">George and Samuel, 1999</xref>), which supports the idea that it is important for viral defense, and also in response to serum starvation (<xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr">Wang et al., 2004</xref>). Moreover, <italic>ADAR1<sup>−/−</sup></italic> mice were unviable, with extensive apoptosis in embryonic tissues normally expressing high levels of ADAR1 (<xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr">Wang et al., 2004</xref>). Apoptosis similarly occurred in <italic>ADAR1<sup>−/−</sup></italic> MEFs during serum starvation. Editing of an unknown substrate by ADAR1 was thought to be necessary for protection against stress-induced apoptosis. It is possible that I-dsRNA-induced SG assembly may facilitate cell survival during stress conditions. dADAR mutant flies had an increased resistance to reactive oxygen species (ROS) (<xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">Chen et al., 2004</xref>). This was the result of selective changes in gene expression, which included upregulation of two genes encoding potential ROS scavengers. Conversely, these genes were downregulated when dADAR was overexpressed. Changes in expression appeared to be indirectly regulated by dADAR. This is consistent with our model whereby editing results in reduced gene expression in <italic>trans</italic>.</p>
      <p>TSN interacts with and promotes specific cleavage of I-dsRNA (<xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr">Scadden, 2005</xref>). We previously speculated that cleavage was important as part of an antiviral mechanism or to regulate aberrantly edited cellular dsRNAs. As TSN is an integral part of the I-dsRNA stress complex (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>D), we now propose that cleavage of I-dsRNA could provide an efficient means of switching off the I-dsRNA-induced silencing pathway. It is intriguing that TSN is activated in mouse vascular smooth muscle cells during oxidative stress (<xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr">Sakamoto et al., 1999</xref>).</p>
      <p>We have put forward a provocative model whereby gene regulation occurs in response to A-to-I editing by ADARs. In accordance with this model, I-dsRNA has the potential to alter localization, stability or translation of mRNA, in <italic>trans</italic>. However, we cannot rule out the possibility that the observations made using I-dsRNA represent a more general quality control pathway in the cell that could be activated by other aberrantly structured RNAs. Future work will shed light on the scope of the proposed pathway.</p>
