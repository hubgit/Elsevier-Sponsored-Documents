      <abstract>
        <p>Insulin stimulates endothelial NO synthesis, at least in part mediated by phosphorylation and activation of endothelial NO synthase at Ser1177 and Ser615 by Akt. We have previously demonstrated that insulin-stimulated NO synthesis is inhibited under high culture glucose conditions, without altering Ca<sup>2+</sup>-stimulated NO synthesis or insulin-stimulated phosphorylation of eNOS. This indicates that stimulation of endothelial NO synthase phosphorylation may be required, yet not sufficient, for insulin-stimulated nitric oxide synthesis. In the current study we investigated the role of supply of the eNOS substrate, <sc>l</sc>-arginine as a candidate parallel mechanism underlying insulin-stimulated NO synthesis in cultured human aortic endothelial cells. Insulin rapidly stimulated <sc>l</sc>-arginine transport, an effect abrogated by incubation with inhibitors of phosphatidylinositol-3′-kinase or infection with adenoviruses expressing a dominant negative mutant Akt. Furthermore, supplementation of endothelial cells with extracellular <sc>l</sc>-arginine enhanced insulin-stimulated NO synthesis, an effect reversed by co-incubation with the <sc>l</sc>-arginine transport inhibitor, <sc>l</sc>-lysine. Basal <sc>l</sc>-arginine transport was significantly increased under high glucose culture conditions, yet insulin-stimulated <sc>l</sc>-arginine transport remained unaltered. The increase in <sc>l</sc>-arginine transport elicited by high glucose was independent of the expression of the cationic amino acid transporters, hCAT1 and hCAT2 and not associated with any changes in the activity of ERK1/2, Akt or protein kinase C (PKC). We propose that rapid stimulation of L-arginine transport contributes to insulin-stimulated NO synthesis in human endothelial cells, yet attenuation of this is unlikely to underlie the inhibition of insulin-stimulated NO synthesis under high glucose conditions.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>Cardiovascular disease is the principal cause of morbidity and mortality in patients with diabetes and is associated with endothelial dysfunction, characterised by reduced nitric oxide (NO) bioavailability, a key early mechanism in the progression of atherosclerosis <xref rid="b0005" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>. The molecular mechanisms that underlie the association between diabetes, atherosclerosis and endothelial dysfunction are not, however, fully characterised. Insulin is a direct-acting vasodilator in intact vessels <xref rid="b0010 b0015" ref-type="bibr">[2,3]</xref> and stimulates NO production in cultured endothelial cells <xref rid="b0020 b0025" ref-type="bibr">[4,5]</xref>. We and others have reported that insulin-stimulated NO synthesis is the result of phosphatidylinositol-3′-kinase (PI3 K)-mediated stimulation of Akt (also known as protein kinase B (PKB)) and subsequent phosphorylation and activation of endothelial NO synthase (eNOS) at Ser1177 and Ser615 <xref rid="b0025 b0030 b0035" ref-type="bibr">[5–7]</xref>.</p>
      <p>We have previously demonstrated that culture of human aortic endothelial cells (HAECs) in high glucose abrogated insulin-stimulated NO synthesis, without altering Ca<sup>2+</sup>-stimulated NO synthesis, indicating a specific downregulation of insulin signalling by high glucose <xref rid="b0025" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>. Furthermore, high glucose had no effect on insulin-stimulated phosphorylation of eNOS at Ser1177 or Ser615 <xref rid="b0025 b0035" ref-type="bibr">[5,7]</xref>. Similar studies in bovine aortic endothelial cells (BAECs) also demonstrated an inhibition of insulin-stimulated NO synthesis by culture in high glucose, with only a modest inhibition of insulin-stimulated Ser1179 (bovine equivalent of Ser1177) phosphorylation <xref rid="b0040" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>. We therefore reasoned that the dissociation of eNOS phosphorylation and NO synthesis specific to insulin-stimulated cells implies that stimulation of Akt and subsequent phosphorylation of eNOS may be required, yet insufficient, for insulin-stimulated NO synthesis in cells cultured in high glucose. Candidate mechanisms that might underlie this eNOS phosphorylation-independent mechanism, include altered supply of the eNOS substrate, <sc>l</sc>-arginine <xref rid="b0045" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>, or altered regulation of eNOS activity by interactions with proteins including heat shock protein (Hsp) 90 <xref rid="b0050" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref> and caveolin-1 <xref rid="b0055" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>.</p>
      <p>Long-term (8 h) stimulation with insulin has previously been demonstrated to increase the transport of <sc>l</sc>-arginine in cultured human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs), in a manner sensitive to the protein synthesis inhibitor, cycloheximide <xref rid="b0045" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>. It has also been reported that <sc>l</sc>-arginine transport can be rapidly increased by various stimuli in HUVECs, indicating a capacity for regulation of transport independent of changes in transporter protein expression <xref rid="b0060 b0065" ref-type="bibr">[12,13]</xref>. In endothelial cells, <sc>l</sc>-arginine transport is mediated by system y<sup>+</sup>, reflecting activity of the cationic amino acid (CAT) transporters and system y<sup>+</sup>L, which reflects heterotrimeric amino acid transporter activity <xref rid="b0070" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>. The potential rapid effects of insulin on <sc>l</sc>-arginine transport, and thereby eNOS substrate availability have yet to be characterised. In the current study we investigated the role of <sc>l</sc>-arginine transport as a potential mechanism underlying insulin-stimulated NO synthesis.</p>

      <title>Results</title>
      <p>We first addressed whether <sc>l</sc>-arginine supplementation affects insulin-stimulated NO synthesis. In the presence of physiological concentrations of extracellular <sc>l</sc>-arginine (80 μM), insulin-stimulated NO synthesis was significantly increased approximately 3.5-fold, an effect attenuated by the addition of 10 mM <sc>l</sc>-lysine, an inhibitor of <sc>l</sc>-arginine transport (<xref rid="f0005" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>A).</p>
      <p>Insulin rapidly (10 min) significantly stimulated the transport of <sc>l</sc>-arginine in HAECs 1.7 ± 0.2-fold (<xref rid="f0005" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>B). Preincubation with the PI3 K inhibitor, wortmannin, completely and significantly inhibited insulin-stimulated <sc>l</sc>-arginine transport in HAECs (<xref rid="f0005" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>B). Preincubation of HAECs with the structurally unrelated PI3 K inhibitor, LY294002 gave quantitatively similar results to those with wortmannin (<xref rid="f0005" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>B).</p>
      <p>Next we investigated the role of the downstream PI3 K effector, Akt, in insulin-stimulated <sc>l</sc>-arginine transport using Ad.Akt-DN or Ad.Akt-CA. Infection of HAECs with Ad.Akt-DN significantly reduced insulin-stimulated <sc>l</sc>-arginine transport by approximately 30% without reducing basal transport (<xref rid="f0005" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>C). In HAECs infected with Ad.Akt-CA, basal <sc>l</sc>-arginine transport was significantly increased by 44% compared to control adenovirus infected HAECs, yet insulin stimulation had no further significant effect on <sc>l</sc>-arginine transport (<xref rid="f0005" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>C).</p>
      <p>To determine whether insulin-stimulated <sc>l</sc>-arginine transport was impaired by culture in high glucose, we cultured cells in 5 mM or 25 mM glucose for 48 h and assessed basal and insulin-stimulated <sc>l</sc>-arginine transport. High glucose significantly increased basal <sc>l</sc>-arginine transport 2.1 ± 0.4-fold (<xref rid="f0010" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>A). Culture glucose concentration had no significant effect on insulin-stimulated <sc>l</sc>-arginine transport, yet insulin elicited a significant 37% reduction in <sc>l</sc>-arginine transport in HAECs cultured in high glucose (<xref rid="f0010" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>A). The glucose-stimulated increase in basal <sc>l</sc>-arginine transport was unaffected by preincubation with wortmannin, but was abrogated by incubation with the MEK inhibitor, PD98059, or the PKC inhibitor, bisindolylmaleimide I (<xref rid="f0010" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>B). High glucose had no effect on basal or insulin-stimulated Akt Ser473 phosphorylation (<xref rid="f0015" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>). Neither high glucose nor insulin had any effect on the phosphorylation of either MARCKS or ERK1/2, except for a modest, non-significant increase in ERK 1/2 phosphorylation in response to the osmotic control, mannitol (<xref rid="f0015" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>). PMA elicited a marked increase in the phosphorylation of both MARCKS and ERK1/2 (<xref rid="f0015" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>). HAECs expressed both hCAT1 and hCAT2B, but not hCAT2A, as assessed by semi-quantitative PCR (data not shown). High glucose had no effect on the mRNA expression (data not shown) or protein levels of hCAT1 or hCAT2 (<xref rid="f0015" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>).</p>

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>The principal findings of this study are that insulin rapidly stimulates <sc>l</sc>-arginine transport, an effect attenuated by the PI3 K inhibitor, wortmannin, or infection with adenoviruses expressing dominant-negative mutant Akt. Furthermore, downregulation of <sc>l</sc>-arginine transport attenuates insulin-stimulated NO synthesis.</p>
      <p>The relationship between arginine supply and nitric oxide synthesis is complex. Several reports have indicated that exogenous <sc>l</sc>-arginine improves NO synthesis, yet the intracellular concentrations of <sc>l</sc>-arginine exceed the K<sub>M</sub> of eNOS, such that additional <sc>l</sc>-arginine should not further stimulate NO synthesis – the ‘arginine paradox’ <xref rid="b0075 b0080" ref-type="bibr">[15,16]</xref>. Previous studies in HUVECs demonstrated that prolonged incubation with insulin stimulated <sc>l</sc>-arginine transport in a manner sensitive to the protein synthesis inhibitor cycloheximide <xref rid="b0045" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref> and concomitantly increased mRNA expression of CAT transporters, an effect abrogated by inhibitors of PI3K, PKC and ERK 1/2 <xref rid="b0085" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>. The rapid stimulation by insulin reported in this study, however, is unlikely to reflect de novo synthesis of transporter proteins and was, at least in part, mediated by Akt activation, suggesting insulin-stimulated Akt activity directly phosphorylates transporters or stimulates transporter activity through a less direct mechanism. The observation that basal and insulin-stimulated HAEC NO synthesis was increased by extracellular <sc>l</sc>-arginine indicates that <sc>l</sc>-arginine transport may indeed contribute to insulin-stimulated NO synthesis. In support of this hypothesis, the effect was abrogated by co-incubation (for 5 min) with high concentrations of <sc>l</sc>-lysine, used in the <sc>l</sc>-arginine transport assay to inhibit transport. A similar effect has been reported in A23187-stimulated EA.hy926 cells by <sc>l</sc>-lysine <xref rid="b0090" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>.</p>
      <p>Culture in high glucose concentrations markedly increased <sc>l</sc>-arginine transport in HAECs, in agreement with previous studies in HUVECs <xref rid="b0045" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>. PCR experiments demonstrated that HAECs expressed mRNA for hCAT1 and hCAT2B, but not hCAT2A, as has previously been reported in HUVECs <xref rid="b0095" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>. One previous study in HUVECs has reported that incubation in high glucose for 6 h markedly increased hCAT1 mRNA levels <xref rid="b0100" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>, yet the level of hCAT1 protein was not reported. In the current study, hCAT1 and hCAT2 protein levels in HAECs were unaffected by glucose culture concentration, indicating that the glucose-stimulated change in arginine transport is likely to reflect a change in activity, rather than expression of the hCAT isoforms. Furthermore, the effect of high glucose was attenuated by inhibitors of either ERK1/2 or PKC but was insensitive to wortmannin, suggesting that both PKC and ERK1/2 activity contribute to increased <sc>l</sc>-arginine transport. In the current study, PKC activity was not altered by glucose and/or insulin as assessed by phospho-MARCKS immunoblots. In addition, no change in ERK 1/2 phosphorylation or expression was observed in response to glucose and/or insulin. Incubation with high glucose has been reported to rapidly (5 min–6 h) stimulate PKC activity in HAECs and HUVECs and ERK phosphorylation in HUVECs <xref rid="b0100 b0105 b0110" ref-type="bibr">[20–22]</xref>. The different effects of high glucose on PKC and ERK1/2 phosphorylation compared to these more short-term studies are likely to reflect the very different timescales of stimulation with high glucose. Indeed, in HAECs, prolonged high glucose culture conditions were reported to have no effect on ERK1/2 phosphorylation <xref rid="b0115" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>, in agreement with the current study.</p>
      <p>Taken together, these data suggest that insulin rapidly stimulates <sc>l</sc>-arginine transport via a PI3K-Akt-dependent mechanism, which contributes to insulin-stimulated NO synthesis. High glucose conditions also increase <sc>l</sc>-arginine transport in an ERK1/2 and PKC inhibitor-sensitive manner. As we detected no apparent activation of either of these kinases under high glucose conditions, it seems likely that basal ERK1/2 and PKC activity are required for the response to high glucose, rather than activation itself. It is clear, therefore, that there is no simple quantitative relationship between arginine transport and NO synthesis, as insulin stimulates NO synthesis and <sc>l</sc>-arginine transport, but inhibits high glucose stimulated <sc>l</sc>-arginine transport, in agreement with previous studies in HUVECs <xref rid="b0045" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>. Indeed, insulin-stimulated HAECs cultured in normal or high glucose conditions had very similar rates of <sc>l</sc>-arginine transport, as described previously <xref rid="b0045" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>, yet elicit different rates of NO synthesis <xref rid="b0025" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>. It therefore is likely that although <sc>l</sc>-arginine transport contributes to insulin-stimulated NO synthesis in normal glucose concentrations, impaired <sc>l</sc>-arginine transport does not underlie the impaired insulin-stimulated NO synthesis observed in HAECs cultured in high glucose <xref rid="b0025" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>.</p>
      <p>In conclusion, we propose that while increased supply of <sc>l</sc>-arginine contributes to insulin-stimulated NO synthesis, reduced insulin-stimulated <sc>l</sc>-arginine transport does not explain the specific reduction in insulin-stimulated NO synthesis we have previously demonstrated under high glucose conditions. Further work is necessary to identify the mechanisms impaired by high glucose culture conditions. Such studies should include an analysis of the regulation of subcellular localisation of eNOS and association of eNOS with caveolin-1 and/or Hsp90.</p>
