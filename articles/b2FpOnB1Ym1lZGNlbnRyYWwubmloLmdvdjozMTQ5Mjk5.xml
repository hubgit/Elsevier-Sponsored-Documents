      <abstract>
        <p>The tendency to interpret ambiguous everyday situations in a relatively negative manner (negative interpretation bias) is central to cognitive models of depression. Limited tools are available to measure this bias, either experimentally or in the clinic. This study aimed to develop a pragmatic interpretation bias measure using an ambiguous scenarios test relevant to depressed mood (the AST-D).<xref rid="fn1" ref-type="fn">1</xref> In Study 1, after a pilot phase (<italic>N</italic> = 53), the AST-D was presented via a web-based survey (<italic>N</italic> = 208). Participants imagined and rated each AST-D ambiguous scenario. As predicted, higher dysphoric mood was associated with lower pleasantness ratings (more negative bias), independent of mental imagery measures. In Study 2, self-report ratings were compared with objective ratings of participants’ imagined outcomes of the ambiguous scenarios (<italic>N</italic> = 41). Data were collected in the experimental context of a functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging scanner. Consistent with subjective bias scores, independent judges rated more sentences as negatively valenced for the high versus low dysphoric group. Overall, results suggest the potential utility of the AST-D in assessing interpretation bias associated with depressed mood.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>Biased information processing is an important marker of negative mood, and contributes to the development of depression and anxiety disorders (<xref rid="b0100" ref-type="bibr">Mathews &amp; Macleod, 2005</xref>). A negative interpretation bias refers to the attribution of a negative compared to a benign or positive meaning to an ambiguous situation (<xref rid="b0035" ref-type="bibr">Butler &amp; Mathews, 1983</xref>); it is relative, and considering a lack of positive interpretation bias is also of interest. Negative interpretation bias has been associated with clinical depression and depressed mood (dysphoria) (<xref rid="b0035 b0085 b0120" ref-type="bibr">Butler &amp; Mathews, 1983; Lawson, MacLeod, &amp; Hammond, 2002; Rude, Valdez, Odom, &amp; Ebrahimi, 2003</xref>). Cognitive models of depression suggest that negative interpretation bias – seeing one’s glass as perpetually half empty rather than half full – is critical to the maintenance of depressed mood (<xref rid="b0010" ref-type="bibr">Beck, 1976</xref>). Promoting a less negative interpretation bias is an important component of successful cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) for depression (<xref rid="b0050" ref-type="bibr">Hollon et al. 2005</xref>).</p>
      <p>CBM<xref rid="fn2" ref-type="fn">2</xref> techniques have recently been developed to target such negative biases directly via computer-based training rather than face-to-face therapy (<xref rid="b0090" ref-type="bibr">MacLeod, Koster, &amp; Fox, 2009</xref>). For positive CBM interpretation bias (CBM-I), participants are trained to resolve situations that initially appear ambiguous in a benign/positive rather than negative way. CBM-I was initially developed in the context of anxiety disorders (e.g. <xref rid="b0040 b0095" ref-type="bibr">Grey &amp; Mathews, 2000; Mathews &amp; Mackintosh, 2000</xref>). A CBM-I procedure emphasising the use of mental imagery to simulate scenarios, has been developed to reduce vulnerability to depressed mood (<xref rid="b0025 b0065" ref-type="bibr">Blackwell &amp; Holmes, 2010; Holmes, Lang, &amp; Shah, 2009</xref>).</p>
      <p>Experiments and treatments designed to modify interpretation bias would clearly benefit from tools to measure it. Perhaps surprisingly, the choice is currently limited; the measures include a physiological test – measuring the magnitude of blink reflex (from a puff of air to the eye) in response to ambiguous stimuli (<xref rid="b0085" ref-type="bibr">Lawson et al. 2002</xref>) – and a behavioral test such as the Scrambled Sentences Task (<xref rid="b0125" ref-type="bibr">Wenzlaff, Wegner, &amp; Pennebaker, 1993</xref>). In the latter, participants are asked to make a sentence from a mixed sequence of words (under a cognitive load and constrained time). The words allow for ‘unscrambling’ into either a negative or positive sentence, thus providing an indication of bias. Such interpretation bias tests are not easy to administer and score. Other variants have not been submitted to basic scrutiny to determine whether they assess a bias relevant to dysphoria or depression (<xref rid="b0090" ref-type="bibr">MacLeod et al. 2009</xref>). A more pragmatic measure for future use in clinical settings includes an ambiguous scenarios test (AST) in which participants are simply required to rate a series of descriptions (e.g. <xref rid="b0070 b0075 b0080" ref-type="bibr">Holmes &amp; Mathews, 2005; Holmes, Mathews, Dalgleish, &amp; Mackintosh, 2006; Hoppitt, Mathews, Yiend, &amp; Mackintosh, 2010</xref>). The initial version of the AST used recognition ratings and required a somewhat complex computation of a bias score (<xref rid="b0095" ref-type="bibr">Mathews &amp; Mackintosh, 2000</xref>). Replacing the recognition task with pleasantness ratings on a 9-point Likert scale simplified this (<xref rid="b0070" ref-type="bibr">Holmes &amp; Mathews, 2005</xref>). Further, to maximise impact, participants were encouraged to simulate the scenarios using mental imagery to resolve ambiguity (<xref rid="b0065" ref-type="bibr">Holmes, Lang, &amp; Shah 2009</xref>; <xref rid="b0080" ref-type="bibr">Hoppitt et al. 2010</xref>). For example, one item read “You are watching the lottery results on TV. As the numbers are called you find out your result”. A positive interpretation would include winning and a negative interpretation, losing. Higher pleasantness ratings indicate a more positive interpretation bias. Since ASTs were initially developed for anxiety such a measure required modification to be valid in the context of depressed mood.</p>
      <p>Our goal in the two studies presented here was to develop an AST measure of interpretation bias by adapting the scenario content for depressed mood (AST-D<sup>1</sup>). In line with <xref rid="b0065" ref-type="bibr">Holmes, Lang, &amp; Shah (2009)</xref>, explicit instructions to imagine the ambiguous situations were included. We predicted that compared to low dysphorics (i.e. people with low levels of depressed mood), high dysphorics (people with high levels of depressed mood) would have a more negative bias on the AST-D (Study 1) as indicated by lower subjective pleasantness ratings. Further, we predicted that participants’ subjective ratings would be corroborated by independent raters’ judgments of written descriptions of the imagined scenarios (Study 2).</p>

        <title>Overview</title>
        <p>A 24-item AST-D was derived from a brief pilot study of 55 scenarios (<italic>N </italic>= 53). The AST-D was then presented in a web-based format (<italic>N </italic>= 208). Participants were instructed to imagine the outcome of each of the ambiguous scenarios, and to rate the pleasantness for each. To check whether differences in imagination were influencing the results, measures of mental imagery (vividness for the AST-D items and the tendency to use mental imagery in everyday life) were included. We predicted that the pleasantness scores on the AST-D would be negatively correlated with Beck Depression Inventory (BDI-II; Beck, Steer, &amp; Brown, 1996) scores independent of the mental imagery measures.</p>

        <title>Pilot phase: AST-D item development</title>
        <p>A pilot set of 55 items was derived from the 20-item AST used previously by <xref rid="b0070 b0075" ref-type="bibr">Holmes and Mathews (2005), and Holmes et al. (2006)</xref> by adding 35 further depression-relevant items. People with clinical and research experience in depression devised the items. An example of a new scenario was “You wake up, get out of bed, stretch and really notice how you feel today.” This item could be interpreted either positively (e.g. they imagine feeling energetic), or negatively (e.g. they imagine feeling lethargic). A pilot study presented online these 55 scenarios to 53 participants (30 females, 78% aged between 18–34) whose BDI-II scores were recorded simultaneously. The participants with the 25% highest BDI-II (<italic>M </italic>= 14.75, <italic>SD </italic>= 4.39) and 25% lowest BDI-II (<italic>M </italic>= 0.33, <italic>SD </italic>= 0.65) scores were identified. For each scenario, the mean pleasantness ratings of the two groups were compared, choosing the 24 items showing largest effects. Thus, piloting reduced the initial 55-item set to 24 items, forming the AST-D (Appendix A) used in the current study.</p>

          <title>AST-D</title>
          <p>The 24 ambiguous scenarios were presented individually, followed by ratings e.g. “It’s New Year’s Eve. You think about the year ahead of you” (Appendix A). Participants were instructed to: “Form a mental image of each of the scenarios. Imagine each scenario happening to you personally. Follow the first image that comes to mind, don’t think too much about each one. Then rate how pleasant your image is, as well as how vivid it is.” The pleasantness rating was given on a 9-point Likert scale anchored from <italic>extremely unpleasant</italic> to <italic>extremely pleasant</italic>. The vividness rating was made on a 7-point Likert scale anchored from <italic>not vivid at all</italic> to <italic>extremely vivid</italic>. While the term ‘pleasantness rating’ is used henceforth, it does not simply refer to a ‘pleasant meaning positive’ dimension since its range extends from negative (extremely unpleasant) to positive (extremely pleasant).</p>

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>These results provide initial support for a simple to administer AST-D as an index of interpretation bias in depressed mood. Using a web-based study, the AST-D demonstrated good consistency in a population of students. The pleasantness ratings on this measure were negatively correlated with depressed mood (BDI-II), as would be predicted by the presence of a negative interpretation bias. This correlation was independent of vividness of the imagination of the AST-D scenarios, and of tendency to use mental imagery. Further, as predicted, high and low dysphoric groups differed significantly on the AST-D pleasantness ratings.</p>
      <p>Although not key to our hypotheses, one unexpected finding was the higher SUIS scores in the high dysphoric group (<xref rid="t0010" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). It is possible that such scores might reflect the presence of intrusive negative imagery – a feature of increasing research interest (<xref rid="b0110 b0130" ref-type="bibr">Patel et al. 2007; Williams &amp; Moulds, 2007</xref>). However, the mean values show only a modest difference and future research is needed to test replicability and further hypotheses about imagery in depression (<xref rid="b0055" ref-type="bibr">Holmes , Lang &amp; Deeprose, 2009</xref>).</p>
      <p>It could be argued that since all ratings were subjective, the results may merely represent an anhedonic response. That is, dysphoric participants might subjectively experience less positive emotion in response to the imagery, rather than producing a more negative interpretation of the ambiguous stimuli per se. Participants’ actual interpretations were not recorded in this web-based study. Study 2 meant to address this issue by eliciting written descriptions of ambiguous scenarios’ imagined outcomes and using independent judges to rate these.</p>

          <title>Overview</title>
          <p>Written descriptions of the ambiguous scenarios’ imagined outcomes were elicited so that interpretation bias could be rated both subjectively (as in Study 1) and by independent raters. The AST-D was presented in an experimental context – an fMRI scanning study, consistent with the aim to develop a tool to be used in a variety of settings. We predicted that the number of scenarios the judges rated negatively would correlate negatively with participants’ pleasantness ratings on the AST-D. Further, it was expected that more descriptions from high dysphoric participants would be objectively categorized as negative compared to descriptions from low dysphorics.</p>

        <title>Procedure</title>
        <p>Participants were instructed to imagine the ambiguous scenarios as in Study 1. They were asked to remember each imagined outcome, in order to describe them once out of the scanner (technical limitations render this impossible during scanning). The scenarios were projected on a screen visible from the fMRI scanner (white characters, black background). Each scenario was split between two slides, the first presenting the context and the second containing the ambiguous outcome (e.g. “Slide 1: It’s New Year’s Eve. — Slide 2: You think about the year ahead of you.”). Slide 1 was displayed for 3–8s. according to the length of the text, slide 2 was always presented for 10s. allowing time to imagine the outcome. Participants also underwent a separate heat-perception task as part of a separate study described elsewhere (<xref rid="b0020" ref-type="bibr">Berna, 2010</xref>).</p>
        <p>After imagining each scenario, participants rated its pleasantness using a 2-button response device that moved a cursor continuously along a visual analogue scale presented on the screen, anchored from <italic>extremely unpleasant</italic> to <italic>extremely pleasant</italic>. After exiting the scanner, participants described each of the imagined outcomes on a sheet with the AST-D items.</p>
        <p>Two independent raters (psychology researchers), blind to BDI-II scores, classified each of the 24 descriptions for each participant (<italic>N </italic>= 984 descriptions) into one of three categories: <italic>negative</italic>, <italic>neutral/unclear</italic> or <italic>positive</italic>. Inter-rater reliability between the first and the second judge was good (91%) (<xref rid="b0005" ref-type="bibr">Barker et al. 1996</xref>). A third rater assessed cases of disagreement (<italic>N </italic>= 88). The majority answer was chosen. When all three raters disagreed, the scenario’s valence was considered <italic>unclear</italic> (<italic>N </italic>= 6). For each participant, a sum score of each of the negative, positive and neutral/unclear categories was computed separately.</p>

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>Participants’ subjective AST-D ratings during fMRI scanning replicated findings from Study 1: depressed mood was associated with lower pleasantness ratings indicative of a more negative interpretation bias. Importantly, subjective and objective ratings showed good correspondence. Compared to those of low dysphorics, the descriptions of resolved ambiguous scenarios made by high dysphorics of resolved ambiguous scenarios were judged to be more often negative in content. This is consistent with the AST-D indexing a negative bias in interpretation rather than simply anhedonia.</p>

      <title>General discussion</title>
      <p>Our objective was a readily useable measure of interpretation bias relevant to dysphoria: the 24-item AST-D. In Study 1, the AST-D showed good internal consistency, correlated with depressed mood (BDI-II), and distinguished high versus low dysphorics. Findings were not explained by a lack of vividness in imagining the items or by a difference in tendency to use mental imagery in the high dysphoric group.</p>
      <p>In Study 2, objective ratings confirmed that the descriptions of ambiguous scenarios imagined by a high compared to low dysphoric group were more negative in content. This is consistent with AST-D differences not merely being due to diminished positive affect for the same scenario outcome, but to differing interpretations of the outcome itself. Overall, the AST-D shows promise as a tool to assess interpretation biases for CBT treatment monitoring, experimental research such as CBM-I paradigms (e.g. <xref rid="b0025" ref-type="bibr">Blackwell &amp; Holmes, 2010</xref>) and during fMRI studies on similar topics (e.g. <xref rid="b0030" ref-type="bibr">Browning, Holmes, Murphy, Goodwin, &amp; Harmer, 2010</xref>).</p>
      <p>These studies have a number of limitations. For example, they were conducted on non-clinical samples of students, and validating the AST-D in a general population as well as a clinical sample would be useful. In Study 2, time passed between the imagination and description of the scenarios. While this may have introduced extra variablity and weakened the results, a convergence between objective and subjective ratings was still found. Successful use of the AST-D in the environment of a MR scanner, suggests wide applicability. Finally, since some research suggests that lack of positivity bias is not the same as a negativity bias and there are different correlates, albeit in a different information processing framework (e.g. <xref rid="b0045" ref-type="bibr">Hayden, Klein, Durbin, &amp; Olino, 2006</xref>), further research might seek to develop versions of the AST-D, which could test this possibility.</p>
      <p>Overall, results suggest the potential utility of the AST-D as a simple and thus pragmatic tool to assess interpretation bias associated with depressed mood. Depression and anxiety are highly comorbid and the relation between the two was beyond the scope of the current study but may be of interest in future studies. Since negative interpretation bias is central to cognitive models of depression, and measures are currently lacking both experimentally and in the clinic, the development of tools such as the AST-D is in high demand.</p>

      <p>The 24 ambigsuous scenarios of the AST-D<table-wrap id="t0005" position="float"><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><tbody><tr><td>Your partner asks you to buy a present for their sister’s birthday, as they are busy. When the sister opens it, her face shows you how she feels.</td></tr><tr><td>Your best friend convinces you to go on a blind date and as you sit in the bar waiting to meet your date, you think about how it will go.</td></tr><tr><td>You give a speech at your friend’s wedding. When you have finished, you observe the audience’s reaction.</td></tr><tr><td>You wake up, get out of bed, stretch and really notice how you feel today.</td></tr><tr><td>You go to a place you visited as a child. Walking around makes you feel emotional.</td></tr><tr><td>You are about to move with your partner into a new home. You think about living there.</td></tr><tr><td>You are going to see your sister in her school play. You’ve left it to the last minute to get there. As you drive up to the school and see the parking bays you anticipate the time it will take you to arrive.</td></tr><tr><td>You are lost in a part of a big city you don’t know well. You ask someone on the streets for directions when they pull out something from their pocket.</td></tr><tr><td>You join a tennis club and before long you are asked to play in a doubles match. It’s a tough match and afterwards you discuss your performance with your partner.</td></tr><tr><td>You have recently taken an important exam. Your results arrive with an unexpected letter of explanation about your grade.</td></tr><tr><td>As you walk into the interview room the panel of interviewers welcomes you and proceeds to ask some tough questions. By the end of the interview you know what the outcome is.</td></tr><tr><td>You are starting a new job that you very much want. You think about what it will be like.</td></tr><tr><td>You go to a wedding where you know very few other guests. After the party, you reflect on how the other guests behaved.</td></tr><tr><td>You are organizing the annual office party on a small budget. On the night of the party, you look around to see if people are enjoying themselves.</td></tr><tr><td>You are going to see a very good friend at the station. You haven’t seen them for years. You feel emotional, thinking about how much they might have changed.</td></tr><tr><td>It’s New Year ’s Eve. You think about the year ahead of you.</td></tr><tr><td>You are in a reflective mood and think back at past achievements and disappointments that you have experienced during your life. Overall, your main feelings about your life so far emerge.</td></tr><tr><td>It is an overcast day and you are sitting on the beach. You look up to notice the weather really beginning to change.</td></tr><tr><td>Your neighbours have just had a new baby. You hear it crying. Through the window you see how the husband holds it.</td></tr><tr><td>You are camping in a forest and are very cold. You decide to light a fire. The flames grow in intensity much faster than you imagined.</td></tr><tr><td>Your friend is very keen on skating and persuades you to try it out. At the rink you put on the skates and step on the ice. You glide forward, slowly at first, then faster.</td></tr><tr><td>At the company you are working for there have been big cut backs. One day you are called into see your boss.
