The results suggest that the distinct MSH2 isoforms have differences in their activity. More importantly, they also indicate that, in addition to its role in MMR, TcMSH2 acts in the parasite response to oxidative stress through a novel mitochondrial function that may be conserved in <italic>T. brucei</italic>.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p><italic>Trypanosoma cruzi</italic> is a protozoan parasite of great medical importance, since it causes Chagas’ disease (or American Trypanosomiasis), a malady endemic throughout Latin America, with an estimated 50,000 deaths/year and 100 million people at risk (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://who.int/tdr/diseases/Chagas">http://who.int/tdr/diseases/Chagas</ext-link>). <italic>T. cruzi</italic> belongs to the order Kinetoplastida, which is characterized by the presence of one flagellum and a single mitochondrion in which is situated the kinetoplast, a specialized DNA-containing organelle. Though separated by many millions of years of evolution, <italic>T. cruzi</italic> is related to another kinetoplastid parasite, <italic>T. brucei</italic> <xref rid="bib0005" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>, which continues to afflict the economy and health of the people of sub-Saharan Africa.</p>
      <p><italic>T. cruzi</italic> has a heterogeneous population composed by a pool of strains that circulate in the domestic and sylvatic cycles involving humans, insect vectors and animal reservoirs. Based on studies with a number of molecular markers, the taxon was divided initially in two well-defined groups, so-called <italic>T. cruzi</italic> I and <italic>T. cruzi</italic> II lineages <xref rid="bib0010" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>. More recent studies proposed the existence of six discrete typing units named <italic>T. cruzi</italic> I to VI <xref rid="bib0015" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>. Although the <italic>T. cruzi</italic> population is predominantly clonal, a few hybrid lineages have been identified, including the clone CL Brener, chosen as the reference strain for the genome project <xref rid="bib0020" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>.</p>
      <p>Several reports highlighted the differential genetic diversity between <italic>T. cruzi</italic> I and II lineages and, more importantly, the intra-group variability observed within <italic>T. cruzi</italic> II. Phylogeny studies of DHFR-TS and TR sequences from 31 strains showed that all sequences from <italic>T. cruzi</italic> I strains are monophyletic, whereas sequences from <italic>T. cruzi</italic> II strains are paraphyletic and fall into 3 clades <xref rid="bib0025" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>. Analysis of <italic>T. cruzi</italic> multi-gene families showed that paralogous sequences encoding amastin, an amastigote surface glycoprotein, and TcAG48, an antigenic RNA binding protein, present higher intragenomic variability in <italic>T. cruzi</italic> II and CL Brener strains, when compared with <italic>T. cruzi</italic> I strains <xref rid="bib0030" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>. Likewise, whereas sequences encoding the Tc52 immuno-regulatory protein are homogeneous in strains belonging to the <italic>T. cruzi</italic> I lineage, they show higher sequence polymorphisms in <italic>T. cruzi</italic> II strains <xref rid="bib0035" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>.</p>
      <p>Components of DNA repair pathways are key players in the processes that result in changes in genetic variability within any cell population. Germline mutations in DNA mismatch repair (MMR) genes are associated with susceptibility to hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal human cancer (HNPCC) <xref rid="bib0040" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>. Mutator populations of bacteria, yeast and mammalian cells with defects in mismatch repair have also been described in isolates showing increased frequency of drug resistance <xref rid="bib0045 bib0050 bib0055" ref-type="bibr">[9–11]</xref>. Post-replicative DNA mismatch repair promotes genetic stability by repairing DNA replication errors, inhibiting recombination between non-identical DNA sequences and participating in responses to DNA damage induced by genotoxic agents, such as <italic>N</italic>-methyl-<italic>N</italic>′-nitro-<italic>N</italic>-nitrosoguanidine (MNNG) and cisplatin <xref rid="bib0060 bib0065" ref-type="bibr">[12,13]</xref>. MMR components are also involved in the response to oxidative lesions in DNA such as 7,8-dihydro-8-oxoguanine (8oxoG) <xref rid="bib0070" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>. The initial steps of MMR are accomplished by heterodimers of MSH proteins, named MSH1 to MSH7 in eukaryotes. In <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae,</italic> the MSH2/MSH6 complex, or MutSα, recognizes nuclear base–base mismatches and small (1–2 bp) insertion–deletion (InDel) loops, while MSH2/MSH3 heterodimers, or MutSβ, recognizes a range of small and larger loop-outs. <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> MSH1 protein is involved in mitochondrial genome stability <xref rid="bib0075" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>.</p>
      <p>TcMSH2 was the first component of the MMR machinery described in <italic>T. cruzi</italic> <xref rid="bib0080" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>. Analyses of the <italic>TcMSH2</italic> single copy gene present in different strains of the parasite demonstrated the existence of three isoforms of this protein, named MSH2A, B and C, which correlate with the division in three phylogenetic <italic>T. cruzi</italic> lineages <xref rid="bib0085" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>. A role of MMR in creating differences in genetic variability among <italic>T. cruzi</italic> strains was initially unveiled by studies showing that strains representative of <italic>T. cruzi</italic> II displayed allelic variation of nuclear microsatellite <italic>loci</italic> induced by hydrogen peroxide, the same not occurring in a strain belonging to the <italic>T. cruzi</italic> I lineage <xref rid="bib0090" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>. Moreover, parasites from MSH2 haplogroups B and C were more resistant to cisplatin treatment, as previously reported in other MMR-deficient cells <xref rid="bib0065" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>. These studies suggest that, at least under genotoxic stress conditions, strains belonging to the <italic>T. cruzi</italic> I lineage (presenting the A isoform of <italic>TcMSH2</italic> gene) have a more efficient MMR activity than <italic>T. cruzi</italic> II strains <xref rid="bib0090" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>. They also support the hypothesis that the distinct genetic diversity found in the two <italic>T. cruzi</italic> lineages might be consequence of different levels of MMR efficiency. Therefore, to better understand the mechanisms involved in generating genetic diversity in <italic>T. cruzi</italic> and, more precisely, the role of the MMR pathway, we investigated the response of DNA damaging agents in strains representative of the two main lineages and the activities of different isoforms of <italic>T. cruzi</italic> MSH2 proteins. Using gene deletion analysis to examine the response to oxidative damage, we uncovered a novel function for MSH2, related to mitochondrial DNA repair, which is conserved in both <italic>T. cruzi</italic> and <italic>T. brucei</italic>.</p>

After 1 h of incubation at 4 °C, cells were permeabilized with 0.2% Triton X-100, treated with 100 μg/mL RNase A and incubated with FITC-conjugated avidin (5 μg/mL final concentration) for 1 h at room temperature in the absence of light<italic>.</italic> After washing with PBS and mounted with a solution of 9:1 Glicerol:Tris–HCl, pH 9.0, the slides were visualized under a fluorescence microscope in a 100× oil immersion. Pre-incubation of FITC-conjugated avidin with 0.5 mM of 8oxodG results in 80% decrease in the fluorescence signal, whereas pre-incubation with dGTP has no significant effect on parasite labeling. Fluorescence intensities were averaged with the ImageJ program and plotted as fluorescence arbitrary units (average fluorescence intensity measured in 100 cells after subtracting the average background intensity). Background signals were measured in 100 fields, randomly chosen on the slides.</p>
        <p>The 8-oxoG accumulation was also assessed by HPLC-electrochemical detection. Cells (10<sup>9</sup>/mL) were treated with 20 mM H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> for 1 h at 28 °C, washed with PBS, and the DNA was isolated by the chaotropic NaI method <xref rid="bib0145" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref> in the presence of 0.1 mM desferroxamine. DNA samples (100 μg) were treated with nuclease P<sub>1</sub> and alkaline phosphatase and analyzed by HPLC. Samples (100 μg) of digested DNA were injected into the HPLC/electrochemical detection system consisting of a Shimadzu model LC-10AD pump connected to a Luna C<sub>18</sub> (Phenomenex, Torrance, CA, USA) reverse-phase column (250 mm × 4.6 mm ID, particle size 5 μm). The flow rate of the isocratic eluent (50 mM potassium phosphate buffer, pH 5.5, and 8% methanol) was 1 mL/min. Coulometric detection was obtained with a Coulochem II detector (ESA, Chemsford, MA, USA). The potentials of the two electrodes were set at 120 and 280 mV. Elution of unmodified nucleosides was monitored simultaneously with a Shimadzu SPD-10A UV detector set at 254 nm. A Shimadzu Class-LC10 1.6 software was used to calculate the peak areas. The molar ratio of 8-oxodG to dG in each DNA sample was determined based on coulometric detection at 280 mV for 8-oxodG and on absorbance at 254 nm for dG in each injection.</p>

        <title><italic>T. cruzi</italic> strains display differences in the susceptibility to alkylating agents and hydrogen peroxide</title>
        <p>Cisplatin, a drug widely used in the treatment of cancer, forms intra and inter-strand Platinum-DNA cross-links, which kill the cell if inadequately repaired. <italic>N</italic>-methyl-<italic>N</italic>′-nitro-<italic>N</italic>-nitrosoguanidine (MNNG) is an alkylating agent that induces methylation in the O<sup>6</sup> position of guanine <xref rid="bib0065" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>. MMR-proficient cells are more susceptible to both drugs since MMR proteins may act as DNA damage signal transducers to downstream effectors, participating in the initiation of cell death <xref rid="bib0165" ref-type="bibr">[33]</xref>. We investigated the effect of cisplatin and MNNG on different <italic>T. cruzi</italic> strains by incubation with increasing drug concentrations and determining cell viability after 5 days. The two strains that belong to the <italic>T. cruzi</italic> I group, Silvio X-10 cl1 and Col1.7G2, were more sensitive to treatment with both drug when compared to Esmeraldo cl3 and JG strains (which are <italic>T. cruzi</italic> II strains). The results shown in <xref rid="sec0100" ref-type="sec">Supplementary Fig. 1A and C</xref> extend our previous observations <xref rid="bib0090" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref> to a wider range of strains, confirming that there is a clear distinction between strains from <italic>T. cruzi</italic> I and II groups regarding the response to both DNA damaging agents. At cisplatin concentrations of 20 and 30 μM and MNNG concentrations of 25 and 50 μM, the differences between <italic>T. cruzi</italic> I and <italic>T. cruzi</italic> II strains are statistically significant (<italic>p</italic> ≤ 0.05). The mechanisms underlying the difference in the sensitivity to these drugs involve MMR, since, when we repeated the treatment in the presence of cadmium, a potent inhibitor of ATP binding and hydrolysis activities of MSH2-MSH6 complex <xref rid="bib0170" ref-type="bibr">[34]</xref>, the differences previously observed between the strains were abolished (<xref rid="sec0100" ref-type="sec">Supplementary Fig. 1B and D</xref>).</p>
        <p>Oxidative DNA damage, which can arise from endogenous metabolism, represents a particularly significant threat for an intracellular parasite. To further compare the response of <italic>T. cruzi</italic> I and II parasites to genotoxic agents, we investigated the ability of different <italic>T. cruzi</italic> strains to proliferate in the presence of hydrogen peroxide (H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>). Base lesions arising from oxidative DNA damage, such as 8-oxoG, if not removed by base-excision repair (BER), are recognized by MMR <xref rid="bib0070" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>. To test the response of <italic>T. cruzi</italic> strains to oxidative damage, 200 μM of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> was added to epimastigote cultures and cell viability was determined after 5 days. As shown in <xref rid="fig0040" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>A, the two groups of strains exhibited distinct responses to H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> (<italic>p</italic> ≤ 0.05). In contrast to the results observed with cisplatin and MNNG treatments, <italic>T. cruzi</italic> I strains (Col1.7G2 and Silvio X-10 cl1) were more resistant to hydrogen peroxide treatment than <italic>T. cruzi</italic> II strains (JG and Esmeraldo cl3). These differences cannot be attributed to differences in the redox potential of the strains analyzed, as indicated by the results of comparative analysis of the oxidative metabolism of the strains using the MTT reduction assay (<xref rid="sec0100" ref-type="sec">Supplementary Fig. 2A</xref>) and measuring NADPH production (<xref rid="sec0100" ref-type="sec">Supplementary Fig. 2B</xref>). Also, in contrast to the response to cisplatin and MNNG treatments, cadmium did not abolish the differential responses of the <italic>T. cruzi</italic> strains to H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>. As shown in <xref rid="fig0040" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>B, when parasites were incubated with hydrogen peroxide in the presence of this MMR inhibitor, survival rates of the Silvio X-10 (<italic>T. cruzi</italic> I strain) remain higher than the Esmeraldo strain (<italic>T. cruzi</italic> II) (<italic>p</italic> ≤ 0.05).</p>
        <p>To assess more directly the effect of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>, we examined the accumulation of 8-oxoG in the genome of different <italic>T. cruzi</italic> strains before and after H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> treatment using avidin-conjugated FITC. Avidin is shown to bind with high specificity to 8-oxoG and has been used to detect oxidative DNA damage in different cell types <xref rid="bib0140" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref>. As shown in <xref rid="fig0045" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>A, strains belonging to <italic>T. cruzi</italic> I lineage (Col1.7G2 and Silvio X-10 cl1) present lower levels of the oxidized base than <italic>T. cruzi</italic> II strains (JG and Esmeraldo cl3). This difference (<italic>p</italic> ≤ 0.05) is due to an increased accumulation of 8-oxoG in the kDNA of <italic>T. cruzi</italic> II strains after 20 min in the presence of 200 μM H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> (<xref rid="fig0045" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>B). An increased accumulation of 8-oxoG in the DNA of a <italic>T. cruzi</italic> II strain (<italic>T. cruzi</italic> II) compared to a <italic>T. cruzi</italic> I (Silvio X-10) was also observed in experiments using HPLC/electrochemical detection analysis. Because of its high sensitivity and low saturation values, this method detected a much higher difference (145-fold) in 8-oxoG levels (<xref rid="sec0100" ref-type="sec">Supplementary Fig. 3</xref>).</p>
        <p>To verify whether the differences in the response to DNA damaging drugs could be due to differences in the expression of MSH2 among strains, we performed northern and Western blot analyses<italic>.</italic> As shown in <xref rid="sec0100" ref-type="sec">Supplementary Fig. 4</xref>, no obvious differences the expression of <italic>TcMSH2</italic> mRNA or protein in all strains analyzed were found.</p>

        <p>To directly investigate the role of TcMSH2 in the differential response of parasite strains to genotoxic treatments, we performed sequence analyses as well as <italic>in vitro</italic> assays with two recombinant isoforms of this protein. Whereas Col1.7G2 is a homozygous <italic>T. cruzi</italic> I strain, presenting two identical <italic>TcMSH2</italic>A alleles, CL Brener is a hybrid cloned strain and presents two <italic>TcMSH2</italic> alleles corresponding to MSH2-haplogroups B or C <xref rid="bib0090" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>. The alignment of the complete amino acid sequences of TcMSH2 B and C derived from CL Brener, and the TcMSH2 A from Col1.7G2, identified all common domains and motifs present in MSH2 from other organisms, as described for the <italic>Thermus aquaticus</italic> MutS <xref rid="bib0080" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>. A total of 29 amino acid substitutions, concentrated in domains I and II (mismatch recognition domain and connector domain) and domain V (which contains the Walker ATPase motif and the helix-turn-helix motif involved in the protein dimerization), was identified among the three MSH2 haplogroups, 6 of them corresponding to non-conservative substitutions (<xref rid="sec0100" ref-type="sec">Supplementary Fig. 5</xref>).</p>
        <p>MSH2 are ATPases and, while ATP binding seems not be required for initial recognition of mismatched substrate, ATP hydrolysis is involved in the subsequent steps of MMR <xref rid="bib0175 bib0180" ref-type="bibr">[35,36]</xref>. Using <italic>in vitro</italic> assays, we compared ATP hydrolysis activities of recombinant TcMSH2 derived from <italic>T. cruzi</italic> I and II strains. As shown in <xref rid="fig0050" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>A and C, recombinant TcMSH2 A, the isoform present in <italic>T. cruzi</italic> I strains shows higher levels of ATP hydrolysis after 2 h incubation when compared with the TcMSH2 B isoform, present in <italic>T. cruzi</italic> II strains. In <xref rid="fig0050" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>B, it is also shown that cadmium has an inhibitory effect on the <italic>in vitro</italic> TcMSH2 ATPase activity.</p>

        <p>To examine genetically the involvement of the MMR pathway in the differential response of <italic>T. cruzi</italic> to DNA damage, we attempted to generate null mutants for the <italic>TcMSH2</italic> gene. Using plasmid constructs aimed at homologous recombination with the <italic>TcMSH2</italic> gene, single allele deletions of <italic>TcMSH2</italic> (<italic>ΔTcmsh2::HYG/TcMSH2</italic> parasites) could readily be achieved in different parasite strains. However after several attempts, including transfections with constructs that are specific for both CL Brener alleles, we were not able to generate <italic>TcMSH2</italic> null mutants. As shown in <xref rid="sec0100" ref-type="sec">Supplementary Fig. 6A</xref>, DNA amplifications with primers specific for <italic>TcMSH2</italic> alleles B and C, which are present in the CL Brener genome (see <xref rid="sec0100" ref-type="sec">Supplementary Fig. 6B</xref>) and DNA isolated from two transfected cloned cell lines showed that the resistance gene was integrated at the <italic>TcMSH2-B</italic> allele. Disruption of the <italic>TcMSH2-B</italic> allele was also confirmed by Southern blot (<xref rid="sec0100" ref-type="sec">Supplementary Fig. 6C and D</xref>) and by the analysis of <italic>TcMSH2</italic> transcript levels, which were reduced to about 50% after the single-allele deletion (<xref rid="sec0100" ref-type="sec">Supplementary Fig. 6E</xref>). Analysis of more than 10 distinct <italic>ΔTcmsh2::HYG</italic> clones showed that, in every case, deletion of the <italic>TcMSH2-B</italic> allele had occurred (data not shown).</p>
        <p>To investigate the phenotype of <italic>TcMSH2</italic> mutants, epimastigote culture of wild type and <italic>ΔTcmsh2::HYG/TcMSH2</italic> clones were compared. No significant difference of the growth curves of wild type and mutant cells were observed (data not shown). We also compared the growth of wild type and <italic>ΔTcmsh2::HYG/TcMSH2</italic> clones in the presence of increasing concentrations of cisplatin and found no differences (<xref rid="fig0055" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref>A). In contrast, when treated with 200 or 300 μM H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>, all three cloned <italic>ΔTcmsh2::HYG/TcMSH2</italic> mutants presented a significantly lower tolerance (<italic>p</italic> ≤ 0.05) than wild type cells (<xref rid="fig0055" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref>B).

Although we observed no significant differences in the levels of 8-oxoG present in the nuclei of wild type and mutant strains before or after treatment with H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>, increased amounts of the oxidized base were observed in the kDNA of <italic>ΔTcmsh2::HYG/TcMSH2</italic> mutant cell lines compared to wild type parasites (<italic>p</italic> ≤ 0.05).</p>

Similar to <italic>T. cruzi ΔTcmsh2::HYG/TcMSH2</italic> clones, <italic>T. brucei MSH2</italic> null mutants (<italic>ΔTbmsh2::BSD/Tbmsh2::PUR</italic>) are more sensitive to H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> than wild type <xref rid="bib0105" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>. To ask if this phenotype is also a manifestation of mitochondrial DNA damage, <italic>TbMSH2</italic> null mutants and wild type parasites were grown in increasing concentrations of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> for 72 h and the DNA content of the cells analyzed microscopically after staining with DAPI. Kinetoplast (K) and nuclear (N) DNA synthesis and segregation occur at distinct times during the <italic>T. brucei</italic> cell cycle <xref rid="bib0185" ref-type="bibr">[37]</xref>, meaning that parasites with 1N1K, 1N2K and 2N2K contents are found, normally representing the majority (∼98%) of cell types in wild type cultures; the small minority of cells with differing N–K ratios (‘others’) arise due to errors in DNA replication, segregation or mitosis. Here, we found that, even before H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> treatment, <italic>Tbmsh2</italic> mutants displayed an elevation in the proportion of aberrant cells. Whereas the very small numbers of these aberrant cells in the wild type were essentially equally distributed between 0N1K and 2N1K types (<xref rid="fig0060" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref>A), virtually all were characterized by a loss of kDNA (predominantly having a 1N0K configuration) in the <italic>Tbmsh2</italic> null mutants (<xref rid="fig0060" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref>A–C). Treatment of <italic>Tbmsh2</italic> mutants with H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> accentuated this loss of kDNA to an extent that was substantially more pronounced (<italic>p</italic> ≤ 0.05) than in wild type cells (<xref rid="fig0060" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref>A). These data suggest that in <italic>T. brucei</italic>, MSH2 deficiency, before and after H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>-induced damage, results in accelerated loss of mitochondrial DNA, consistent with a function for MSH2 in mitochondrial genome repair or protection.</p>

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>MMR corrects mismatches generated during DNA replication. It also contributes to the control of endogenous levels of oxidized DNA bases present in the genome such as 8-oxoG <xref rid="bib0070" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>. In the <italic>T. cruzi</italic> population, MSH2, a central component of MMR, is encoded by three distinct alleles which can be correlated with the three major <italic>T. cruzi</italic> lineages <xref rid="bib0085 bib0090" ref-type="bibr">[17,18]</xref>. Because distinct levels of genetic variability have been described among parasite strains belonging to each MSH2 haplogroup, we investigated the activity of this MMR protein and its involvement in the response of different parasite strains to various DNA damaging agents. In so doing, we reveal two things. First, the level of MMR activity is distinct between <italic>T. cruzi</italic> lineage I and II strains. Second, we obtained evidences indicating that MSH2 in both <italic>T. cruzi</italic> and <italic>T. brucei</italic> provides a hitherto unseen function in protecting mitochondrial DNA from oxidative damage.</p>
      <p>The involvement of MMR in generating genetic diversity and drug resistance has been described in several organisms, including pathogenic bacteria and other protozoan parasites. Analyses of hypermutable bacteria of different species isolated from human clinical isolates have shown that <italic>mutS</italic> inactivation is implicated in the mutator phenotype <xref rid="bib0190" ref-type="bibr">[38]</xref>. In <italic>Toxoplasma gondii</italic>, disruption of mitochondrial <italic>MSH1</italic> was found in parasites selected for monensin-resistance, a drug proven to be effective against apicomplexan parasites. As expected, the <italic>MSH1</italic> mutants were also resistant to the alkylating agent methylnitrosourea <xref rid="bib0195" ref-type="bibr">[39]</xref>. <italic>Plasmodium</italic> species are the only eukaryotes that encode two <italic>MSH2</italic> homologs. Disruption of one the <italic>MSH2</italic> loci in <italic>Plasmodium falciparum</italic> resulted in a slightly higher frequency of parasites resistant to 5-Fluoroorotate when mosquito-passaged mutants and wild type parasites were compared, suggesting that the function of the two <italic>PfMSH</italic>2 genes may overlap <xref rid="bib0200" ref-type="bibr">[40]</xref>. Here we show that <italic>T. cruzi</italic> I and II strains respond differently when treated with genotoxic agents, such as cisplatin and MNNG. Because this difference was abolished when MMR activity was inhibited by cadmium, we suggest that the differential response among strains to these DNA damaging agents is due to differential activity of one of more components of the MMR. In agreement with previous studies with MMR mutants in different eukaryotic cells <xref rid="bib0065" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>, the observed increased tolerance to cisplatin and MNNG in <italic>T. cruzi</italic> II parasites can be inferred to result from less efficient MMR. This is also consistent with previous results showing that <italic>T. cruzi</italic> II strains have increased nuclear genetic variability when compared with strains belonging to <italic>T. cruzi</italic> I lineage, an observation that may have major epidemiological significance <xref rid="bib0030" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>. The differences observed between strains in the response to genotoxic agents cannot be associated with different levels of expression of <italic>TcMSH2</italic>, since, in all strains analyzed, the levels of <italic>TcMSH2</italic> mRNA and protein were found to be similar. However, because <italic>T. cruzi</italic> I and <italic>T. cruzi</italic> II strains present distinct TcMSH2 isoforms, we proposed that sequence polymorphisms in TcMSH2 may be at least partially responsible for the differences in the response to these DNA damaging agents, an assumption that was corroborated by the results showing differences in ATPase activities from recombinant proteins MSH2A and MSH2B. Notwithstanding, variations in the efficiency of other components of MMR, as well as from other DNA repair pathways are also likely to be involved in modulating mutation rates in the <italic>T. cruzi</italic> population. Attempts to determine whether differences in mutation rates can be observed among distinct strains are underway.</p>
      <p>To further investigate the role of TcMSH2 protein, we attempted to generate null mutants for the <italic>TcMSH2</italic> gene. Unexpectedly, we were unable to delete both alleles. This inability to generate <italic>MSH2</italic> null mutants is in sharp contrast with most other eukaryotes, including <italic>T. brucei</italic> bloodstream forms. Bloodstream forms of <italic>TbMSH2</italic> null mutants are viable, present an increased rate of sequence variation of nuclear microsatellite <italic>loci</italic> and increased tolerance to MNNG, as well as an increased frequency of homologous recombination <xref rid="bib0105 bib0205" ref-type="bibr">[21,41]</xref>. The availability of <italic>TbMSH2</italic> null mutants allowed us to test whether the <italic>TcMSH2</italic> gene can complement MMR deficiency in <italic>T. brucei</italic> <xref rid="bib0110" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>. Although we were able to demonstrate heterologous expression of <italic>T. cruzi</italic> MSH2, MMR complementation, as assayed by resistance to MNNG and microsatellite instability, was not achieved. However, expression of <italic>TcMSH2</italic> in <italic>TbMSH2</italic> null mutants resulted in reversion of the sensitivity to H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>-induced oxidative stress. The observation described here that this mutation gives rise to a significant percentage of the dyskinetoplastic cells in <italic>T. brucei</italic>, even in the absence of induced oxidative stress, is striking. In contrast to <italic>T. cruzi</italic> epimastigote metabolism, which is largely dependent on oxidative phosphorylation and generates endogenous oxidative damage, <italic>T. brucei</italic> bloodstream forms rely exclusively on glycolysis for ATP production, which may explain why <italic>TbMSH2</italic> null mutants are viable.</p>
      <p>Taken together, the results of the complementation assays in <italic>T. brucei</italic>, the non-viability of <italic>TcMSH2</italic> mutants, and the common phenotypes observed in the <italic>TcMSH2</italic> single knockout and <italic>TbMSH2</italic> null mutants suggest that MSH2 provides a function related to mitochondrial genome integrity in addition to its role in nuclear MMR. Such additional functions may be independent of at least some other components of MMR, since <italic>TbMLH1</italic> null mutants do not present increased sensitivity to H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> <xref rid="bib0110" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>. This finding is consistent with the observation here that incubation of <italic>T. cruzi</italic> cells with cadmium abolished the differences observed between strains in response to treatment with cisplatin and MNNG, but not with H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>:cadmium is known to suppress the ATPase activity of MSH2/MSH6 complexes <xref rid="bib0165" ref-type="bibr">[33]</xref>, which is likely to impair interaction with MLH1-containing heterodimers <xref rid="bib0180" ref-type="bibr">[36]</xref>. In both <italic>Trypanosoma</italic> species MSH2 abundance in <italic>MSH2</italic> mutants appears sufficient for nuclear MMR function. However, the <italic>Tcmsh2</italic> mutants showed higher sensitivity to H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>-induced oxidative stress than wild type cells and increased accumulation of 8-oxoG, particularly in the kDNA. It can be speculated that the involvement of TcMSH2 in the response to oxidative stress is so relevant to mitochondrial function that a loss of a single allele would have a significant impact<italic>.</italic> The nature of such a mitochondrial role for MSH2 is unknown. Perhaps the protein compensates for the lack of MSH1, a mitochondrial DNA repair protein, for which an orthologous gene could not be identified in the <italic>T. cruzi</italic> genome <xref rid="bib0020" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>. A role of MSH2 in the control of oxidative DNA damage has been previously described in other cell types, such as mouse embryo fibroblasts in which increased levels of DNA 8-oxoG were detected after inactivation of the <italic>MSH2</italic> gene <xref rid="bib0210" ref-type="bibr">[42]</xref>. Additional functions of MSH2, MSH3, and PMS2 mismatch repair proteins have also been described, including homologous recombination, anti-recombination, DNA damage signaling, apoptosis, as well as site-specific mutagenesis during immunoglobulin somatic hypermutation and class switch recombination (reviewed in <xref rid="bib0215" ref-type="bibr">[43]</xref>). Nevertheless, these functions have been limited to nuclear activities, and the mitochondrial role we see here for MSH2 appears not to have been described thus far in any other organism.</p>
      <p>Being an intracellular parasite, oxidative damage may have a significant effect on mutation rates in <italic>T. cruzi</italic>. In addition of MMR, other DNA repair pathways such as Base Excision Repair (BER) are certainly involved in the parasite response to oxidative damage in DNA. We and others have characterized two DNA polymerase beta from <italic>T. cruzi</italic> and showed that both enzymes co-localize with the parasite kinetoplast <xref rid="bib0220" ref-type="bibr">[44]</xref>. <italic>T. cruzi</italic> has a complex antioxidant defense system that includes enzymes like Fe-SOD (mitochondrial iron-containing superoxide dismutase), TcMPX and TcCPX (mitochondrial and cytoplasmic tryparedoxin peroxidases, respectively), and TcAPX (ascorbate-dependent haemoperoxidase), which are upregulated during transformation of the insect-derived non-infective epimastigotes into the infective metacyclic trypomastigote <xref rid="bib0225" ref-type="bibr">[45]</xref><italic>.</italic> The evidences presented here indicating a novel role of MSH2 in <italic>T. cruzi</italic> and <italic>T. brucei</italic> in the complex mechanisms responsible for the oxidative stress response require further investigation, particularly regarding the study of MSH2 sub-cellular localization and interactions with other proteins. Whether this new role of MSH2 is part of the driving force behind the differential genetic variability observed within the <italic>T. cruzi</italic> population, it also remains to be investigated.</p>
