        <p>Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is associated with hepatic insulin resistance with the molecular basis of this association being not well understood. Here we studied the effect of hepatic triglyceride accumulation induced by postprandial triglyceride-rich lipoproteins (TGRL) on hepatic insulin sensitivity in HepG2 cells. Incubation of HepG2 cells with purified TGRL particles induced hepatocellular triglyceride accumulation paralleled by diminished insulin-stimulated glycogen content and glycogen synthase activity. Accordingly, insulin-induced inhibition of glycogen synthase phosphorylation as well as insulin-induced GSK-3 and AKT phosphorylation were reduced by TGRL. The effects of TGRL were dependent on the presence of apolipoproteins and more pronounced for denser TGRL. Moreover, TGRL effects required the presence of heparan sulfate-proteoglycans on the cell membrane and lipase activity but were independent of the cellular uptake of TGRL particles by receptors of the LDL receptor family. We suggest postprandial lipemia to be an important factor in the pathogenesis of NAFLD.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>Type 2 diabetes is frequently associated with non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) which is characterized by hepatic fat accumulation and insulin resistance. Insulin resistance has been shown to promote hepatic fat accumulation through various mechanisms (<xref rid="b0030 b0055" ref-type="bibr">Chen et al., 1987; Ginsberg, 2006</xref>). Whether hepatic fat accumulation, in turn, may be a direct cause of insulin resistance, in particular of hepatic insulin resistance, is still a matter of debate (<xref rid="b0020 b0125" ref-type="bibr">Boden, 1997; Marchesini et al., 2005</xref>). One possible mechanism by which hepatic fat may induce hepatic insulin resistance is the development of oxidative stress (<xref rid="b0185" ref-type="bibr">Videla, 2009</xref>).</p>
      <p>The sources of fatty acids stored in liver as triglycerides are diverse and the quantitative contribution of various fatty acid sources to NAFLD in humans is not well defined. In the postabsorptive state, fatty acids mainly derive from adipose tissue. In the postprandial state, de novo lipogenesis, spillover of non-esterified fatty acids (NEFA) after lipoprotein lipase (LPL)-mediated lipolysis of intestinally derived chylomicrons and hepatic uptake of the resulting triglyceride-depleted remnant particles (<xref rid="b0005" ref-type="bibr">Barrows and Parks, 2006</xref>) are the major sources of hepatic triglycerides. Using magnetic resonance spectroscopy, it could be demonstrated that postprandial triglycerides are rapidly incorporated into the hepatic triglyceride pool in both normal and diabetic subjects (<xref rid="b0165" ref-type="bibr">Ravikumar et al., 2005</xref>). The liver has a central role in chylomicron remnant catabolism (<xref rid="b0050" ref-type="bibr">Cooper, 1997</xref>) which is underlined by the observation that defenestration of the sinusoidal endothelium and, consequently, an abolishment of the livers capability to eliminate chylomicron remnants from the circulation is closely correlated with massive hypertriglyceridemia in animal models (<xref rid="b0045" ref-type="bibr">Cogger et al., 2006</xref>). Studies have shown that a large portion of chylomicron remnants are bound to heparan sulfate proteoglycans (HSPG) on the endothelial wall of peripheral capillary beds where their triglyceride portion undergoes initial LPL-mediated lipolysis resulting in an increase in chylomicron remnant density (<xref rid="b0105" ref-type="bibr">Karpe et al., 2007</xref>). With an increase in density, the affinity of chylomicron remnants to adhere to the endothelial wall decreases (<xref rid="b0100" ref-type="bibr">Karpe et al., 1997</xref>). As a consequence, chylomicron remnants re-enter plasma and eventually reach the space of Disse after having reached a size corresponding to a Svedberg flotation rate (<italic>S</italic><sub>f</sub>) of up to 400 allowing them to pass the 100–200 nm sized pores in the protecting endothelium (<xref rid="b0040" ref-type="bibr">Cogger et al., 2004</xref>). During the process of lipolysis, chylomicron remnants become enriched with Apo E (<xref rid="b0010" ref-type="bibr">Batal et al., 2000</xref>) which has been shown to bind to LPL (<xref rid="b0075" ref-type="bibr">Huff et al., 1997</xref>), hepatic lipase (HL) (<xref rid="b0110" ref-type="bibr">Krapp et al., 1996</xref>) and LDL-receptor-related protein (LRP), a receptor mediating hepatic chylomicron remnant clearance (<xref rid="b0015 b0065" ref-type="bibr">Beisiegel et al., 1989; Herz et al., 1991</xref>). LPL and HL also possess LRP-binding properties of their own (<xref rid="b0110 b0145" ref-type="bibr">Krapp et al., 1996; Olivecrona and Lookene, 1997</xref>), further enhancing the affinity of chylomicron remnants towards the LRP.</p>
      <p>In the present work, we sought to analyze the effects of hepatic triglyceride accumulation induced by postprandial triglyceride-rich lipoproteins (TGRL) with a <italic>S</italic><sub>f</sub> &lt; 400, i.e. chylomicron remnants and VLDL/VLDL remnants, on several parameters of hepatic insulin sensitivity using the human hepatoblastoma-derived cell line HepG2. Our decision to study postprandial lipoproteins was based on the following observations suggesting that the postprandial state plays an important role in the development of NAFLD, hepatic insulin resistance and skeletal muscle insulin resistance. Firstly, we have previously shown that insulin sensitivity is impaired during the state of postprandial lipemia in healthy men (<xref rid="b0160" ref-type="bibr">Pedrini et al., 2006</xref>) and, moreover, that postprandial TGRL particles cause insulin resistance in cultured skeletal muscle cells (<xref rid="b0155" ref-type="bibr">Pedrini et al., 2005</xref>). Secondly, postprandial lipids represent a substantial source of hepatic triglycerides in vivo in humans (<xref rid="b0005" ref-type="bibr">Barrows and Parks, 2006</xref>; Ravikumar et al., 2005), yet have been incompletely studied as a potential factor in the pathogenesis of NAFLD and hepatic insulin resistance. Thirdly, in Westernized societies, a large part of the day or even of life is spent in the state of postprandial lipemia.</p>

        <p>To test whether TGRL have toxic effects on HepG2 cells, we measured lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) in the incubation media at the beginning and end of all lipoprotein incubations. We did not observe any rise in LDH concentration upon TGRL incubation. In addition, possible TGRL-induced apoptosis was excluded using 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) staining of the cells. Cell viability after treatment with TGRL was assessed by trypan blue exclusion. Viability was found to be equal to that in non-TGRL-treated cells. For all these assays, H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> (0.3% for 20 min) was used as a positive control.</p>

        <title>Reduction of glycogen content and glycogen synthase activity by TGRL</title>
        <p>First, we performed a series of concentration–response and time course experiments to determine the concentration of TGRL triglycerides in the incubation media and the length of incubation time for all following experiments using the analysis of insulin-induced glycogen content, a sensitive parameter for insulin sensitivity. In the concentration–response experiments, we started at a concentration of 40 mg/dl lipoprotein triglycerides, which we previously demonstrated to induce insulin resistance in L6 skeletal muscle cells (<xref rid="b0155" ref-type="bibr">Pedrini et al., 2005</xref>) and compared it to 80 mg/dl. Overnight incubation with TGRL at a triglyceride concentration of 80 mg/dl significantly reduced insulin-stimulated glycogen content (<xref rid="f0005" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>A). Next, we studied the effect of TGRL on glycogen content as a function of incubation time. TGRL at a triglyceride concentration of 80 mg/dl were added to the incubation media and incubated for 3, 6 and 18 h. As shown in <xref rid="f0005" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>B, a significant reduction of insulin-induced glycogen content was reached with overnight incubation, i.e. after 18 h. Hence, a dose of 80 mg/dl lipoprotein triglycerides and overnight incubations were chosen for all following experiments.</p>
        <p>Next, we studied the effect of TGRL on insulin-stimulated glycogen synthase activity. The significant insulin stimulation of glycogen synthase activity was lost when cells were incubated in the presence of TGRL (<xref rid="f0005" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>C).</p>

In agreement with the changes noted for glycogen synthase phosphorylation, insulin-mediated phosphorylation of GSK-3 α at serine 21 and GSK-3 β at serine 9 was significantly impaired by TGRL (<xref rid="f0010" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>B). Accordingly, the phosphorylation of AKT at serine 473, a signaling step upstream of GSK-3, was also impaired by TGRL (<xref rid="f0010" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>C).</p>

        <p>To assess whether the observed effects were specific for triglycerides assembled in intact lipoprotein particles, we conducted control experiments using an apolipoprotein-free lipid emulsion (Intralipid®). Intralipid® was purified by extensive dialysis and matched for triglycerides in TGRL particles.</p>
        <p>As shown in <xref rid="f0015" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>B, Intralipid® induced an increase in the intracellular triglyceride content.

Accordingly, Intralipid® reduced insulin-stimulated glycogen content to 76 ± 33% of control, whereas TGRL reduced insulin-stimulated glycogen content significantly to 47 ± 23% (<xref rid="f0015" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>C).</p>

        <p>To test whether TGRL size plays a role in their uptake and capability to induce insulin resistance, we pooled respective rotor effluent volumes to obtain one fraction of TGRL with <italic>S</italic><sub>f</sub> of 20–60 corresponding to very dense chylomicron remnants and VLDL remnants, and another fraction of TGRL with flotation rates 60–400 corresponding mainly to VLDL and more buoyant chylomicron remnants (<xref rid="b0175" ref-type="bibr">Shepherd and Packard, 1987</xref>). For the following experiments, the two lipoprotein fractions were normalized to their triglyceride content.

        <p>LDL receptor-related protein (LRP) has been shown to be an important component of the hepatic removal process of TGRL. To investigate whether the effects of TGRL on hepatic insulin sensitivity were receptor-mediated, we co-incubated cells with TGRL and receptor-associated protein (RAP), known to block binding of ligands to receptors of the LDL family (<xref rid="b0065 b0130" ref-type="bibr">Herz et al., 1991; Medh et al., 1995</xref>).

As shown in <xref rid="f0025" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref>B, RAP did not significantly alter TGRL effects on insulin sensitivity in HepG2 cells, whereas in rat L6 myocytes, used as a positive control, RAP abolished the TRGL effect on glycogen content (<xref rid="f0025" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref>C).</p>

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>Patients diagnosed with NAFLD have been shown to exhibit prolonged and exaggerated phases of postprandial lipemia as well as decreased insulin sensitivity compared to healthy controls (<xref rid="b0135" ref-type="bibr">Musso et al., 2003</xref>). In our study, we elucidated several factors linking hepatic triglyceride accumulation induced by postprandial lipoproteins to hepatic insulin resistance.</p>
      <p>Our data on glucose metabolism and insulin signaling show internally consistent results with TGRL particles reducing insulin effects in a dose- and time-dependent fashion. The effects on these processes were accompanied by hepatocellular triglyceride accumulation indicating that liver steatosis may be a direct cause of hepatic insulin resistance. One mechanism in development of hepatic insulin resistance through hepatic fat may be increased rates of mitochondrial fatty acid beta-oxidation, a process known to lead to enhanced reactive oxygen species (ROS) production (<xref rid="b0070" ref-type="bibr">Houstis et al., 2006</xref>).</p>
      <p>To find out which component of TGRL particles is responsible for the observed effects, we used Intralipid®, a lipid emulsion closely resembling TGRL particles except for the lack of apolipoproteins. With Intralipid®, we observed a less pronounced effect on intracellular triglyceride accumulation compared to TGRL suggesting that triglycerides not assembled in lipoproteins are capable of causing comparable effects to TGRL, but apolipoproteins are required to achieve maximal effects. This may be due to the well known effects of apolipoproteins on the binding properties of TGRL and various enzymatic processes. The decreased intracellular triglyceride accumulation with Intralipid® as compared to TGRL particles was associated with reduced effects on glycogen content, underlining the concept of a causal relationship between hepatic triglyceride content and hepatic insulin resistance.</p>
      <p>Comparing TGRL of different densities, we found denser TGRL particles with a <italic>S</italic><sub>f</sub> of 20–60 to be more effective in intracellular lipid accumulation and in reducing glycogen content. One potential explanation for these observations comes from our experiments showing that denser TGRL particles contain more LPL, thus, enhancing the affinity of TGRL remnants towards HSPG and LRP.</p>
      <p>Our experiments with heparinase pre-treatment of HepG2 cells show that binding of chylomicron remnants to HSPG is a prerequisite for internalization as HSPG mediate TGRL adherence to the cell surface where they are brought together with HL which is also bound to HSPG (<xref rid="b0090" ref-type="bibr">Ji et al., 1997</xref>). Therefore, our results obtained by HSPG cleavage may be caused by lack of adherence of TGRL to the cell surface as well as removal of HSPG-bound HL from the cell membrane.</p>
      <p>From our experiments with THL, we conclude that triglyceride hydrolization by HL is another crucial prerequisite for intracellular triglyceride accumulation. After hydrolization, the resulting NEFA pass the cellular membrane and are re-esterified to di- and tri-glycerides (<xref rid="b0060" ref-type="bibr">Guo et al., 2006</xref>). In agreement, the addition of RAP to the incubation media blocking the LRP (<xref rid="b0190" ref-type="bibr">Willnow et al., 1994</xref>) had no effect on TGRL-induced insulin resistance suggesting that the effects of TGRL on insulin sensitivity are independent of receptor-mediated uptake of the triglyceride-depleted remnant particles. Various studies suggest chylomicron remnant uptake to be LRP-mediated, but these studies were mainly performed with I<sup>125</sup> labeled lipoproteins whereby only a minor fraction of the tracer is found in the lipid fraction of the lipoproteins (<xref rid="b0110" ref-type="bibr">Krapp et al., 1996</xref>). Our study suggests the lipid fraction to be solely responsible for the effects observed. Further support for independence of TGRL effects of their receptor-mediated uptake comes from a recent report showing that HSPG are involved in hepatic triglyceride clearance independently of receptors of the LDL family (<xref rid="b0120" ref-type="bibr">MacArthur et al., 2007</xref>) as well as from previous studies demonstrating that the inhibition of the LRP does not exert any effect on triglyceride accumulation derived from VLDL isolated from hypertriglyceridemic subjects (<xref rid="b0035" ref-type="bibr">Cianflone et al., 1996</xref>).</p>
      <p>Interestingly, a previous study investigating the effect of TGRL on insulin-stimulated glycogen synthesis could not find any effect of TGRL on insulin-dependent glycogen metabolism (<xref rid="b0170" ref-type="bibr">Rinninger et al., 1986</xref>). Methodological differences could represent a possible explanation for this discrepancy including the assay used to determine insulin-stimulated glycogen metabolism. In their study, incorporation of radiolabeled glucose into glycogen was measured, thus, only accounting for glycogen synthesis, but not for differences in glycogenolysis, which, however, has been shown to play a pivotal role in changes in hepatic insulin-dependent glycogen metabolism during postprandial lipemia (<xref rid="b0180 b0025" ref-type="bibr">Stingl et al., 2001; Boden et al., 2002</xref>). In our study, we used the determination of total glycogen content taking into account both glycogen synthesis and glycogenolysis and, therefore, yielding larger effect sizes. Accordingly, in our study, the changes induced by insulin and TGRL on glycogen synthase activity and phosphorylation were rather small compared to the changes in glycogen content.</p>
      <p>We are aware that our results ought to be interpreted with caution since, inherent to all cell culture models of diseases, the effects observed in vitro may be diminished or even divergent if other tissues are present. On the other hand, in vivo studies conducted to demonstrate that postprandial TGRL cause hepatic insulin resistance involve metabolic alterations not restricted to liver, such as an acute decrease in skeletal muscle insulin sensitivity or secondary hyperglycemia and hyperinsulinemia (<xref rid="b0085 b0080" ref-type="bibr">Itani et al., 2002; Ide et al., 2004</xref>) making conclusions in regard to TGRL as the causative agent very difficult. Therefore, we strongly believe that our data are of significance since we were able to show conclusively that TGRL induce hepatic insulin resistance using a cell line which is well established and widely accepted for studying lipoprotein metabolism in human hepatocytes.</p>
      <p>In conclusion, our experiments support the concept that liver steatosis may be a direct cause of hepatic insulin resistance. Our data indicate that the hepatic accumulation of triglycerides through TGRL particles requires prior hydrolysis of TGRL triglycerides at the cell membrane, a process dependent on the presence of HL and HSPG. LRP-mediated uptake of the resulting remnant particles is not required for intracellular triglyceride accumulation and the development of hepatic insulin resistance since these remnants consist mainly of apolipoproteins and cholesteryl esters, and are presumably devoid of sufficient amounts of triglycerides to impair insulin sensitivity.</p>
      <p>Together with our previous studies on TGRL-induced muscle insulin resistance and on insulin resistance during postprandial lipemia (<xref rid="b0155 b0160" ref-type="bibr">Pedrini et al., 2005, 2006</xref>), this study may be interpreted to suggest that the almost persistent phases of postprandial lipemia in many Westernized societies play an important role not only in the development of NAFLD and its associated hepatic insulin resistance, but also in the development of whole body insulin resistance and the metabolic syndrome.</p>
