        <title>Summary</title>
        <p>Cell migration during wound healing requires adhesion receptor turnover to enable the formation and disassembly of cell-extracellular matrix contacts. Although recent advances have improved our understanding of integrin trafficking pathways, it is not known how extracellular ligand engagement controls receptor dynamics. Using atomic force microscopy, we have measured cell avidity for fibronectin and defined a mechanism for the outside-in regulation of α<sub>5</sub>β<sub>1</sub>-integrin. Surprisingly, adhesive strength was attenuated by the syndecan-4-binding domain of fibronectin due to a rapid triggering of α<sub>5</sub>β<sub>1</sub>-integrin endocytosis. Association of syndecan-4 with PKCα was found to trigger RhoG activation and subsequent dynamin- and caveolin-dependent integrin uptake. Like disruption of syndecan-4 or caveolin, gene disruption of RhoG in mice was found to retard closure of dermal wounds due to a migration defect of the fibroblasts and keratinocytes of RhoG null mice. Thus, this syndecan-4-regulated integrin endocytic pathway appears to play a key role in tissue repair.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>The uninjured dermis of adult mammals comprises predominantly collagen and nonmigratory fibroblasts, and contains only very low levels of fibronectin. Upon wounding, blood plasma floods from ruptured vessels into the damaged tissue, triggering recruitment of fibroblasts into the wound bed and leading to wound contraction (<xref rid="bib25" ref-type="bibr">Shaw and Martin, 2009</xref>). The development of strategies to accelerate or control repair processes requires an understanding of how changes in the extracellular matrix (ECM) are communicated across the plasma membrane to direct cell behavior. α<sub>5</sub>β<sub>1</sub>-integrin is the prototypic fibronectin receptor, but fibronectin-dependent signaling depends upon simultaneous engagement of the transmembrane proteoglycan, syndecan-4, which acts as a fibronectin coreceptor (<xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr">Morgan et al., 2007</xref>). Disruption of the <italic>Sdc4</italic> gene in mice results in delayed wound healing due to compromised motility of fibroblasts, demonstrating a clear role for syndecan-4 in the healing process (<xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr">Echtermeyer et al., 2001</xref>). In vitro, cooperative engagement of syndecan-4 and α<sub>5</sub>β<sub>1</sub>-integrin by fibronectin causes transient activation of Rac1 (<xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr">Bass et al., 2007</xref>), rapid inhibition of RhoA (<xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr">Bass et al., 2008</xref>), and subsequent reactivation of RhoA (<xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">Dovas et al., 2006</xref>), thus promoting cycles of membrane protrusion followed by cytoskeletal contraction that are necessary for cell migration.</p>
      <p>The direct relationship between syndecan-4 and α<sub>5</sub>β<sub>1</sub>-integrin has not been explored. Syndecan-4 activates PKCα by direct association (<xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr">Koo et al., 2006</xref>), and there is evidence that PKCα can cause the activation (<xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr">Han et al., 2006</xref>) or endocytosis of integrin (<xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr">Ng et al., 1999</xref>). Such reports raise the possibility that syndecan-4-dependent PKCα regulation might influence the activity or surface availability of integrins in fibronectin-stimulated fibroblasts. In this study, we use atomic force microscopy (AFM) to measure directly the effect of syndecan-4 engagement on cell avidity for the integrin-binding domain of fibronectin. We find that, contrary to expectation, engagement of syndecan-4 reduces cell avidity for fibronectin by inducing integrin endocytosis. We delineate the signaling pathway by which syndecan-4 induces integrin redeployment, and finally demonstrate that genetic disruption of the key signaling intermediary results in a fibroblast-mediated healing defect. Based on these observations, we redefine the function of syndecan-4 as follows: first, syndecan-4 acts as an integrin regulator, rather than a coreceptor; second, syndecan-4 induces integrin trafficking rather than stabilization; and third, each of these syndecan-4-regulated steps is necessary for efficient wound repair. These advances provide an explanation for how fibroblasts recognize the change in ECM composition following injury and why they become more motile in a fibronectin-rich environment.</p>

        <title>Engagement of Syndecan-4 Reduces Cell Avidity for Integrin Ligands</title>
        <p>Cell migration requires modulation of the adhesive strength by formation and disassembly of integrin-mediated adhesive contacts. To probe the contributions of integrins and syndecans to the generation of adhesion strength, we used AFM to measure directly the energy required to disengage cells from the ECM. A series of 5 s contacts were made between single fibroblasts, captured on a cantilever, and matrix protein-coated glass (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>A), and the deflection of the cantilever was recorded as the cells were withdrawn from the glass surface (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>B). This arrangement allowed us to record the unbinding energy for the same cell after contact with different surfaces, and thereby enabled avidity changes to be tracked in single cells rather than being averaged across populations. Analysis of individual cells also ensured that all data were obtained from live cells because cell death caused immediate loss of unbinding “steps” and a fall in maximum force. The 5 s contact times were sufficient for integrin binding, but not cytoskeletal reorganization (<xref rid="bib27" ref-type="bibr">Taubenberger et al., 2007</xref>), allowing specific interrogation of integrin regulation.</p>
        <p>To test the effect of syndecan-4 engagement on cell avidity for α<sub>5</sub>β<sub>1</sub>-integrin ligand, cells were contacted with patches of plasma fibronectin, which contains α<sub>5</sub>β<sub>1</sub>-integrin- and syndecan-4-binding motifs, or patches of a recombinant 50 kDa fragment of fibronectin (50K) encompassing the binding site for α<sub>5</sub>β<sub>1</sub>-integrin alone. Equivalent density of integrin ligand on the fibronectin and 50K surfaces was tested and confirmed by ELISA using a monoclonal antibody directed against the integrin-binding domain of fibronectin (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>C).</p>
        <p>Withdrawal of a fibroblast from either 50K or fibronectin resulted in an unbinding curve with several features: (1) maximum deflection represented the maximum force that could be applied before integrin tethers were broken; (2) area under the curve represented total energy required to detach a cell from the ECM; and (3) breakage of individual tethers was represented by a series of steps on the curve (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figures 1</xref>B and 1D). Because syndecan-4 engagement is known to activate adhesive signals and drive focal adhesion formation (<xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr">Bass et al., 2007</xref>), we had predicted that more energy would be required to detach a cell from fibronectin than 50K. In fact the opposite effect was observed (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figures 1</xref>D and 1E). Stimulation of cells with a soluble syndecan-binding fragment of fibronectin, comprising type III repeats 12–15 (H/0), also resulted in low unbinding energy that no longer varied between 50K and fibronectin surfaces, suggesting that the different binding to fibronectin and 50K was due to syndecan engagement (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figures 1</xref>D and 1E). A striking feature was the highly reproducible nature of the experiment. Although the absolute values obtained from different cells varied, the same response was observed with every cell tested (see <xref rid="app2" ref-type="sec">Figure S1</xref>A available online). Like unbinding energy, the maximum applicable force also decreased upon syndecan-4 engagement (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figures 1</xref>D and 1F).</p>
        <p>To establish specific involvement of syndecan-4, we independently blocked either the receptor or ligand. H/0 that had been preincubated with heparin, thus blocking interaction with the syndecan-4 polysaccharide chains, had no effect on unbinding energy (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>G). <italic>Sdc4</italic><sup>−/−</sup> MEFs failed to respond to fibronectin or soluble H/0 (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>H), unlike wild-type MEFs or those rescued by re-expression of the full-length syndecan-4 cDNA (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figures 1</xref>I and 1J). To identify the integrin regulated by syndecan-4, human fibroblasts were treated with inhibitory monoclonal antibodies. An activity-neutral antibody (K20) had only a very minor effect on unbinding energy, possibly due to steric obstruction, and did not block the response to syndecan-4 engagement by either fibronectin or H/0 (<xref rid="app2" ref-type="sec">Figure S1</xref>B). By contrast, inhibitors of β<sub>1</sub>-integrin (mAb13, <xref rid="app2" ref-type="sec">Figure S1</xref>C) or α<sub>5</sub>-integrin (mAb16, <xref rid="app2" ref-type="sec">Figure S1</xref>D) almost completely blocked binding to 50K or fibronectin. The residual interaction was weaker than that seen after engagement of syndecan-4 and probably due to weak electrostatic interactions of the cell membrane. An inhibitor of α<sub>v</sub>β<sub>3</sub>-integrin (17E6, <xref rid="app2" ref-type="sec">Figure S1</xref>E) had no effect on unbinding energy. These experiments confirm a role for syndecan-4 and demonstrate that the rapid interaction between fibroblasts and fibronectin is mediated by α<sub>5</sub>β<sub>1</sub>-integrin exclusively, rather than α<sub>v</sub>β<sub>3</sub>-integrin, which is noteworthy in itself.</p>
        <p>We next used sequential time course analyses to gain further information about the nature of the syndecan-4-integrin relationship. We recorded a series of contacts with 50K, followed by a series of contacts with fibronectin, before making more contacts with 50K. Contact with fibronectin immediately reduced unbinding energy compared to 50K. This very rapid response identifies syndecan-4 as a hair trigger integrin regulator and indicates that receptors and signaling intermediaries are in close proximity even before fibronectin binding (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figures 1</xref>K and <xref rid="app2" ref-type="sec">S1</xref>F). Upon returning to 50K, the cell recovered, demonstrating that avidity suppression is a reversible signaling event, and not due to cell damage. Plotting the time course of H/0 action (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>L) confirmed that the reduction in avidity was very fast (t½ = 2.6 min), even though the soluble H/0 was not applied directly to the surface of the cell. The rapid response to diffuse ligand was consistent with the 5 s response when syndecan-4 and integrin were engaged in close proximity by contact with fibronectin. Taken together, these experiments reveal negative regulation of integrin by a molecule previously considered to be a coreceptor.</p>

        <title>Integrin Regulation: Inactivation versus Surface Availability</title>
        <p>Initial experiments identified reduction in the avidity of cells for fibronectin upon syndecan-4 engagement. The first step in resolving the mechanism was to distinguish whether change in avidity was a consequence of individual bond weakening or a reduction in the number of bonds made. Inspection of the force released at each unbinding event in the original curves revealed similar distribution of step size and similar average step size when cells were detached from 50K, fibronectin, or 50K in the presence of H/0 (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figures 2</xref>A and 2B). The consistency in step size indicated that bond strength must be similar under all conditions. Instead, the difference in total force or energy required for detachment was due to a reduction in the number of unbinding steps (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>C). Integrins can be found on the cell surface in active and inactive conformations (<xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">Byron et al., 2009</xref>), and so the negative effect of syndecan-4 on α<sub>5</sub>β<sub>1</sub>-integrin could be achieved in two ways: reduction in either the activity of integrin or the abundance of integrin on the cell surface. These possibilities were distinguished by forcing α<sub>5</sub>β<sub>1</sub>-integrin into the active conformation using two different monoclonal antibodies (9EG7 and TS2/16; <xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">Byron et al., 2009</xref>). Application of either antibody increased the energy required to detach cells from 50K (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figures 2</xref>D and 2E; p = 0.017) as expected. Despite the enforced activation of surface integrin, engagement of syndecan-4 still caused a reduction in unbinding energy, demonstrating that syndecan-4 engagement lowers avidity by reducing the total number of α<sub>5</sub>β<sub>1</sub>-integrins on the cell surface, rather than by modulating the activation state of individual receptors.</p>
        <p>Internalization of β<sub>1</sub>-integrin could be visualized by using total internal reflection fluorescence (TIRF) microscopy to follow disappearance of GFP-β<sub>1</sub>-integrin from the focal plane. Cells spread on 50K adhere using small integrin clusters around the cell periphery. The integrin clusters were stable on 50K, but upon application of H/0 there was a reduction in cluster intensity within 1 min (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figures 2</xref>F and 2H and <xref rid="mmc2" ref-type="supplementary-material">Movie S1</xref>A) that did not occur when H/0 was precomplexed with heparin (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figures 2</xref>G and 2H and <xref rid="mmc2" ref-type="supplementary-material">Movie S1</xref>B). Thus, both atomic force and time-lapse experiments are supportive of a mechanism involving internalization of β<sub>1</sub>-integrin upon engagement of syndecan-4. In turn, this led us to look for a syndecan-4-dependent mechanism of integrin endocytosis.</p>
      </sec>
      <sec id="sec2.3">
        <title>Syndecan-4-Dependent Endocytosis of α<sub>5</sub>β<sub>1</sub>-Integrin</title>
        <p>Dynamin is responsible for scission of endocytic vesicles from the plasma membrane and integrin internalization (<xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr">Ng et al., 1999</xref>). We used siRNA targeted against the nonneuronal dynamin isoform, dynamin-2, to test the necessity of endocytosis for reduction of unbinding energy. The response of fibroblasts to syndecan-4 engagement was unaffected by transfection with nontargeted siRNA (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>A). However, reduction of dynamin-2 expression to less than 10% of control blocked the reduction in unbinding energy, indicating that syndecan-4 does indeed reduce cell avidity for fibronectin by triggering endocytosis of α<sub>5</sub>β<sub>1</sub>-integrin (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figures 3</xref>B and <xref rid="app2" ref-type="sec">S2</xref>A). Furthermore, addition of a pharmacological dynamin inhibitor, MiTMAB, blocked the sustained syndecan-4-induced endocytosis of cells already treated with H/0 and restored unbinding energy to the level observed with 50K alone (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>C). The recovery of unbinding energy indicates that the integrins are in dynamic equilibrium between vesicles and the plasma membrane, and that syndecan-4 engagement simply shifts the equilibrium away from the membrane by increasing endocytosis. α<sub>5</sub>β<sub>1</sub>-integrin is recycled through an Arf6-dependent pathway (<xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">Caswell and Norman, 2006</xref>). When Arf6 expression was reduced by RNAi, unbinding energy still decreased when a cell was moved from 50K to fibronectin but did not recover upon return to 50K (<xref rid="app2" ref-type="sec">Figures S2</xref>C–S2E). Thus, it appears that active recycling plays a role in integrin redeployment, but the immediate reduction in cell avidity is entirely an endocytic event.</p>
        <p>Endocytic pathways can be divided into clathrin-dependent or caveolin-dependent mechanisms (<xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">Caswell and Norman, 2006</xref>). RNAi-mediated reduction of clathrin heavy-chain expression, to less than 10%, had no effect on the cell response to syndecan-4 ligand (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>D). By contrast, reduction in caveolin expression to less than 20% blocked the reduction in unbinding energy upon syndecan-4 engagement (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figures 3</xref>E and <xref rid="app2" ref-type="sec">S2</xref>B). Likewise, reduction of caveolin expression in MEFs blocked H/0-triggered disappearance of GFP-β<sub>1</sub>-integrin from the TIRF plane (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>F). Through these experiments, we identify dynamin- and caveolin-dependent endocytosis of α<sub>5</sub>β<sub>1</sub>-integrin as a consequence of syndecan-4 engagement.</p>
        <p>To complement AFM studies, trafficking of integrin and caveolin was investigated further by biochemical fractionation of cells into plasma membrane and vesicle compartments. The segregation of membrane fractions was validated by blotting for marker molecules (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>A). Vesicle markers, early endosome-associated molecule 1 (EEA1) and Rab4, were found exclusively in the small vesicle/soluble fraction, as was tubulin. By contrast, the sodium-potassium ATPase transporter, which is constitutively localized to the cell surface, was restricted to the plasma membrane fraction. As expected, β<sub>1</sub>-integrin was found in both plasma membrane and vesicle fractions (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>A). To test redistribution, fibroblasts were spread onto 50K for 2 hr and then stimulated with H/0 for 0–90 min before fractionating and blotting the plasma membrane fraction. As predicted from AFM, α<sub>5</sub>β<sub>1</sub>-integrin was internalized in response to syndecan-4 engagement, but over a longer time period (90 min) was found to return to the membrane (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figures 4</xref>B and 4C). This second phase of redistribution is important because unidirectional integrin internalization would result in cell detachment, whereas a biphasic response would cause integrin redeployment and formation of new adhesion complexes and thereby enable cell migration. The endocytic phase was slower (t½ = 6.0 min) than that detected by atomic force (t½ = 2.6 min) because, in fractionation experiments, integrin is engaged by immobilized 50K that would oppose internalization. Caveolin also redistributed over a similar time period, confirming that syndecan-4 triggers caveolar endocytosis (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>D). Unlike the integrin redistribution, the decrease in membrane-associated caveolin was preceded by a slight increase (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figures 4</xref>B and 4D). The same trend was observed for pY14-caveolin (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>B), which is necessary for caveolin uptake (<xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">del Pozo et al., 2005</xref>). We propose that H/0 triggers immediate internalization of caveolin-coated membrane but that there is also recruitment of membrane-proximal caveolin that enables a large-scale endocytic response.</p>
        <p>Each of the experiments thus far has examined the influence of syndecan-4 in the context of simultaneous integrin engagement. If syndecan-4 is to be considered an independent regulator of integrin trafficking in response to fibronectin, one would expect syndecan-4-dependent trafficking of both ligated and ligand-free integrin. H/0 stimulation of fibroblasts in suspension still caused integrin redistribution between plasma membrane and vesicle fractions (t½ = 3.7 min, <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>E), demonstrating that syndecan-4 regulates integrin endocytosis, independently of integrin ligation. Collectively, these experiments demonstrate that syndecan-4 is a trigger of caveolar endocytosis that redeploys integrins upon appearance of fibronectin. This model contrasts with the canonical role of syndecan-4 in stabilizing focal adhesions and provides a more logical explanation of how syndecan-4 promotes cell migration during tissue repair.</p>

        <title>Syndecan-4 Drives Endocytosis through the Activation of PKCα and RhoG</title>
        <p>The redistribution of caveolin, in response to H/0, positions caveolin-dependent endocytosis downstream of syndecan-4, but upstream of α<sub>5</sub>β<sub>1</sub>-integrin, in a signaling cascade. Our next aim was to elucidate the link between syndecan-4 and caveolar trafficking. The cells used in this study express syndecan-1, -2, and -4 (<xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr">Bass et al., 2007</xref>), yet disruption of syndecan-4 expression was sufficient to block fibronectin-dependent endocytosis (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>H). Syndecan-4 is unique among syndecan family members in binding and activating PKCα (<xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr">Koo et al., 2006</xref>), making PKCα a prime candidate to connect syndecan and caveolin. Reduction of PKCα expression to less than 10% by RNAi blocked the reduction of unbinding energy upon syndecan-4 engagement (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref>A). Similarly, expression of a PKCα-binding mutant of syndecan-4 (Y188L) failed to rescue the endocytic response in <italic>Sdc4</italic><sup>−/−</sup> MEFs (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref>B), whereas re-expression of wild-type syndecan-4 restored modulation of unbinding energy (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>J). The effect of H/0 could be mimicked by activating PKC directly with 100 nM phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref>C). Treatment of cells with vehicle DMSO had no effect on unbinding energy or the response to fibronectin (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref>D). Curiously, the response to PMA was slower than the response to H/0 (H/0, t½ = 2.6 min; PMA, t½ = 7.7 min). We suggest two equally plausible explanations because, first, syndecan-4 is a better activator of PKCα than are lipid activators as suggested previously (<xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr">Oh et al., 1998</xref>), and second, proximity of syndecan-4 to α<sub>5</sub>β<sub>1</sub>-integrin means that syndecan-4 activates PKCα in the correct location, rather than holistically throughout the cell. Cells transfected with the siRNA targeted against caveolin failed to respond to PMA (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref>E), placing PKCα between syndecan-4 and caveolin on the signaling cascade. Collectively, these experiments show that the interaction between syndecan-4 and PKCα is necessary for caveolin-dependent endocytosis of integrins, and that the molecules lie in a linear pathway: syndecan-4-PKCα-caveolin-endocytosis.</p>
        <p>Our next aim was to identify the pathway activated by PKCα upon syndecan-4 engagement. Although tyrosine phosphorylation of caveolin is necessary for endocytosis (<xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">Cao et al., 2002</xref>), there are no reports that serine/threonine phosphorylation of caveolin by PKCα is important. One possible endocytic mechanism stems from the recent identification of a complex comprising syndecan-4, RhoGDI, and RhoG (<xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">Elfenbein et al., 2009</xref>). <xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">Elfenbein et al. (2009)</xref> reported a syndecan-4-dependent phosphorylation of RhoGDI in response to growth factor stimulation, which led to release and activation of RhoG. RhoG has been linked to two processes: activation of Rac1 through the ELMO/Dock180 complex (<xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr">Katoh et al., 2006</xref>) and caveolar endocytosis of growth factor receptors (<xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr">Samson et al., 2010</xref>). Wild-type RhoG traffics from the plasma membrane to caveolar vesicles, whereas constitutively active RhoG accumulates preferentially in vesicles and accelerates internalization of membrane cargoes (<xref rid="bib22" ref-type="bibr">Prieto-Sánchez et al., 2006</xref>). We hypothesized that RhoG might also trigger integrin endocytosis upon engagement of syndecan-4 by fibronectin. We tested fibronectin-dependent activation of RhoG by effector pull-down using the N terminus of ELMO2 as bait. H/0 stimulation of fibroblasts spread on 50K caused a rapid increase in RhoG activity within 10 min (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref>F), correlating with internalization of β<sub>1</sub>-integrin (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>C). Reduction of RhoG expression to less than 10% of control by RNAi blocked the syndecan-4-dependent reduction in unbinding energy (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figures 5</xref>G and <xref rid="app2" ref-type="sec">S3</xref>), disappearance of GFP-β<sub>1</sub>-integrin from the TIRF plane (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref>H and <xref rid="mmc3" ref-type="supplementary-material">Movie S2</xref>), and loss of β<sub>1</sub>-integrin from the plasma membrane fraction (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref>I), demonstrating that syndecan-4-dependent activation of RhoG is indeed the trigger for integrin endocytosis.</p>
        <p>We have already conjectured that the 5 s response to fibronectin (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>K) necessitates the existence of a preformed endocytic complex, and so we immunoprecipitated β<sub>1</sub>-integrin from cells expressing GFP-RhoG. Not only did RhoG precipitate with β<sub>1</sub>-integrin, but it was enriched in the complex associated with inactive integrin (mAb13, <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref>J). Caveolin was also enriched in the inactive integrin complex, indicating that ligand-free integrin is primed for redeployment through an endocytic pathway. As expected, talin was recruited preferentially to active integrin (12G10). Neither RhoG nor caveolin was recruited to the control transferrin receptor complex (OKT9). Preferential redeployment of inactive β<sub>1</sub>-integrin, rather than ligated integrin, refines the model of fibronectin-induced integrin mobilization and explains why syndecan-4 induces integrin redeployment, rather than cell detachment. The second necessary feature of the integrin-RhoG complex is that RhoGDI should be present in a preformed complex and be released upon syndecan-4 engagement. RhoGDI was indeed detected in the complex when total GFP-β<sub>1</sub>-integrin, but not GFP alone, was immunoprecipitated from MEFs spread on 50K, using a GFP-Trap (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref>K). Ten minute stimulation with H/0, which coincided with the peak in RhoG activity, caused a 46% reduction in bound RhoGDI. Together, these experiments demonstrate that engagement of syndecan-4 by fibronectin causes release of RhoGDI from a β<sub>1</sub>-integrin complex and triggers a wave of RhoG activity that preferentially redeploys inactive α<sub>5</sub>β<sub>1</sub>-integrin through an endocytic mechanism. Combined with the existing knowledge of the links from syndecan-4 to RhoG through PKCα and RhoGDI, we have delineated the molecular pathway responsible for integrin internalization upon exposure to fibronectin.</p>

        <title>The Syndecan-4-RhoG-Caveolin Endocytic Cascade Is Necessary for Wound Closure</title>
        <p>Having identified RhoG as a key molecular link between syndecan-4 and caveolin-dependent endocytosis in vitro, we investigated the role of this pathway in vivo. Both <italic>Sdc4</italic><sup>−/−</sup> and <italic>Cav1</italic><sup>−/−</sup> mice have similar and surprisingly mild phenotypes. Both are viable and fertile, and suffer a delay in wound closure that has been attributed to a defect in fibroblast migration (<xref rid="bib9 bib12 bib23" ref-type="bibr">Echtermeyer et al., 2001; Grande-García et al., 2007; Razani et al., 2001</xref>). <italic>Cav1</italic><sup>−/−</sup> mice also suffer nondetrimental hyperproliferation of some cell types. We hypothesized that if the healing defects of the two mice are a consequence of a disruption in the syndecan-4-RhoG-caveolin signaling cascade, then <italic>Rhog</italic><sup>−/−</sup> mice would suffer a similar defect. The <italic>Rhog</italic><sup>−/−</sup> mouse is also viable and fertile, and the only documented phenotype is a slightly enhanced immune response (<xref rid="bib28" ref-type="bibr">Vigorito et al., 2004</xref>). We investigated the closure of 4 mm punch wounds in 7-week-old <italic>Rhog</italic><sup>−/−</sup> mice by imaging the live mice for 6 days postwounding, and measuring the wound area digitally. Compared to wild-type or heterozygous littermates, <italic>Rhog</italic><sup>−/−</sup> mice exhibited a striking delay in wound closure, with a significantly larger wound area at 1–3 days (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6</xref>A). By day 5, the wound areas of wild-type, heterozygous, and knockout mice were comparable. Defects in wound contraction are generally a consequence of impaired fibroblast migration into the defect, where some subsequently differentiate into contractile myofibroblasts (<xref rid="bib25" ref-type="bibr">Shaw and Martin, 2009</xref>). Macroscopic or histological inspection of the <italic>Rhog</italic><sup>−/−</sup> mice suggested such a defect (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figures 6</xref>A and 6B). Thus, histology of 3 day skin sections revealed the appearance of α-smooth muscle actin-positive myofibroblasts around the wound sites of wild-type and heterozygous mice. In <italic>Rhog</italic><sup>−/−</sup> mice, the number of α-smooth muscle actin-positive cells was reduced to 20%, and positive cells were scattered, indicating a migration defect in the precursor fibroblasts (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figures 6</xref>C–6E). Other cell migration events at the wound site induced by wounding include the recruitment of leukocytes to chemoattractants released by the wounded epithelium and degranulating platelets. Compared to unwounded skin (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6</xref>F), F4/80-positive macrophages were recruited in similar numbers to the wounds of both wild-type and <italic>Rhog</italic><sup>−/−</sup> mice (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6</xref>G). The difference between fibroblast and macrophage recruitment suggests that RhoG is necessary for migration toward syndecan-4 ligands, such as fibronectin, but not other chemoattractants. Thus, <italic>Rhog</italic><sup>−/−</sup> mice exhibited a delay in wound contraction that resembled the reported defect of <italic>Sdc4</italic><sup>−/−</sup> mice (<xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr">Echtermeyer et al., 2001</xref>) and was indicative of a migration defect of dermal fibroblasts, but not immune cells.</p>
        <p>Fibroblast migration along linear fibronectin fibers can be modeled by tracking migration over a fibrillar cell-derived matrix, which reflects the wound environment in vivo (<xref rid="app2" ref-type="sec">Figure S4</xref>). To test the contribution of RhoG to fibronectin-guided migration, RhoG-deficient cells were generated by either RNAi-mediated reduction of RhoG in human fibroblasts or isolation of primary embryonic fibroblasts from the transgenic mice. In both cases, reduced RhoG expression compromised the ability of fibroblasts to proceed persistently over a fibrillar matrix but had no effect on speed of migration (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figures 7</xref>A–7G and <xref rid="mmc4" ref-type="supplementary-material">Movie S3</xref>). The persistence defect resembled that of <italic>Sdc4</italic><sup>−<italic>/</italic>−</sup> MEFs (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figures 7</xref>H–7J), which fail to detect and respond to fibronectin (<xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr">Bass et al., 2007</xref>). If the signal from syndecan-4 to RhoG to caveolin were linear, as proposed, one would expect disruption of multiple components to have no additional effect on persistence, once the cascade is broken. Therefore, we combined knockdown of caveolin and RhoG in wild-type or <italic>Sdc4</italic><sup>−/−</sup> MEFS, and found that removal of multiple molecules had no greater effect than removal of a single component (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figures 7</xref>K and 7L). Together, these experiments identify the syndecan-4-RhoG-caveolin pathway as a regulator of directional migration that enables fibroblast immigration as part of a healing response.</p>
        <p>Fibroblasts are not the only cell type to exhibit altered syndecan-4 expression upon skin wounding. Keratinocytes upregulate syndecan-4 expression around a wound (<xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr">Gallo et al., 1996</xref>) and, like fibroblasts, exhibit altered adhesion characteristics when exposed to the H/0 fragment of fibronectin (<xref rid="bib29" ref-type="bibr">Wilke et al., 1993</xref>). We isolated primary keratinocytes and found that <italic>RhoG</italic><sup>−/−</sup> keratinocytes exhibited reduced migration when compared with wild-type or heterozygous equivalents in a scratch wound assay (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7</xref>M and <xref rid="mmc5" ref-type="supplementary-material">Movie S4</xref>). Therefore, when analyzing cell types that migrate during a wound response, we find that migration of fibronectin-responsive cell types depends on the RhoG signaling axis, whereas others, such as macrophages, do not. When coupled with the fact that syndecan-4 and RhoG knockouts are nonlethal, unlike integrin gene deletions (<xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr">Hynes, 2002</xref>), the role of syndecan-4 in controlling fibronectin-dependent integrin redeployment during the healing process makes syndecan-4 a logical therapeutic target for the manipulation of integrin-dependent migration.</p>

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>In this study, we have elucidated a signaling pathway that controls the cell-surface delivery of α<sub>5</sub>β<sub>1</sub>-integrin during wound healing. Intriguingly, this pathway is initiated by ligand binding to a distinct adhesion receptor, syndecan-4, which therefore identifies the latter as a primary sensor of the adhesive microenvironment. Our key findings are: (1) syndecan-4 engagement reduces cell avidity for fibronectin, contrary to expectation; (2) syndecan-4 regulates surface availability, rather than activity of α<sub>5</sub>β<sub>1</sub>-integrin; (3) syndecan-4 triggers rapid endocytosis of preformed integrin complexes, enriched in inactive integrin, through a caveolin-dependent pathway; (4) activation of RhoG, downstream of PKCα, mediates the endocytic signal; and (5) <italic>Sdc4</italic><sup>−/−</sup>, <italic>Rhog</italic><sup>−/−</sup>, and <italic>Cav1</italic><sup>−/−</sup> mice suffer similar wound closure defects, indicating the importance of this signaling cascade in fibroblast migration episodes in vivo. Collectively, these findings describe a model of integrin redeployment whereby exposure of fibroblasts to fibronectin, upon wounding, results in fibroblast migration to repair the defect.</p>
      <p>Our observation of the reduction in cell avidity for fibronectin was initially surprising because many studies have described syndecan-4-dependent reinforcement of focal adhesions by recruitment of cytoskeletal proteins such as vinculin (<xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr">Bass et al., 2007</xref>). However, enhanced integrin trafficking would be consistent with syndecan-4-regulated activation of Rac1-dependent membrane protrusion (<xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr">Bass et al., 2007</xref>) and inhibition of RhoA-dependent contraction (<xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr">Bass et al., 2008</xref>) at the leading edge. Activation of RhoG and Rac1 and redeployment of α<sub>5</sub>β<sub>1</sub>-integrin could be classed as early-phase migratory events and define syndecan-4 as the initial sensor for fibronectin, which initiates fibroblast migration into the wound bed. Because cell migration requires cycles of membrane protrusion and cytoskeletal contraction, the stabilization of integrin-containing adhesions behind the leading edge, through the reactivation of RhoA (<xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">Dovas et al., 2006</xref>), could be classed as late-phase events and will play an equally important role in fibroblast migration.</p>
      <p>If we are to understand fibronectin-dependent signaling fully, further investigation will be required to resolve the interdependence of GTPase activation and receptor trafficking. The Rac1 regulation that we reported previously (<xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr">Bass et al., 2007</xref>) does not appear to be a direct consequence of α<sub>5</sub>β<sub>1</sub>-integrin trafficking because H/0 stimulation of fibroblasts in suspension causes integrin redistribution (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref>H), but not Rac1 regulation (<xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr">Bass et al., 2007</xref>). Localization of active Rac1 to the leading edge is known to be integrin dependent (<xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">del Pozo et al., 2004</xref>) and mediated by the sequestration of pY14-caveolin, whereas GTP loading of Rac1 is syndecan-4 dependent (<xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr">Bass et al., 2007</xref>) and may even require clathrin-dependent endocytosis of inactive Rac1 (<xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr">Palamidessi et al., 2008</xref>). Conversely, Rac1 activation does not appear to be the driving force behind integrin endocytosis because active Rac1 does not associate with caveolar vesicles or drive endocytosis in the same way as active RhoG (<xref rid="bib22" ref-type="bibr">Prieto-Sánchez et al., 2006</xref>) and could not be detected in our integrin immunoprecipitation experiments. Thus, it appears that each of the protrusive signals is interconnected but that none is exclusively dependent on another. The next challenge will be the determination of how integrin organizes the caveolin microdomains, necessary for localized Rac1 signaling, and whether syndecan-4 regulates the process.</p>
      <p>It is interesting to speculate that the temporal coordination of events may well depend on the proximity of the molecules involved. The very short response time of cells touched onto fibronectin is consistent with the endocytosis of a preformed complex, and we have demonstrated biochemically the presence of RhoG and caveolin in a β<sub>1</sub>-integrin complex. Syndecan-4 is reported to colocalize with integrins in focal adhesions (<xref rid="bib30" ref-type="bibr">Woods et al., 2000</xref>), but the distribution of unengaged receptors is not resolved. If we extrapolate the model of hair trigger endocytosis, we would predict the association of α<sub>5</sub>β<sub>1</sub>-integrin and syndecan-4 in microclusters with caveolin and RhoG. The force required to break individual interactions between α<sub>5</sub>β<sub>1</sub>-integrin and fibronectin has been recorded as 39 ± 8 pN (<xref rid="bib26" ref-type="bibr">Sun et al., 2005</xref>). The force release events that we record during cell detachment range from 37 to 175 pN (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>A); these data are consistent with the presence of microclusters containing one to five α<sub>5</sub>β<sub>1</sub>-integrins. The fact that the force distribution does not change after H/0 stimulation suggests that the mechanism of syndecan-4 action is not based upon increased clustering of unengaged α<sub>5</sub>β<sub>1</sub>-integrin. The more rapid response to H/0 than PKC-activator, PMA action, also relies on proximity of syndecan-4 and α<sub>5</sub>β<sub>1</sub>-integrin, even before fibronectin binding. We speculate that the complete α<sub>5</sub>β<sub>1</sub>-integrin-syndecan-4 cluster is internalized in response to syndecan-4 engagement, and although a paucity of antibodies has prevented direct demonstration of this point, vesicular colocalization of syndecan-2 with β<sub>1</sub>-integrin has been reported (<xref rid="bib31" ref-type="bibr">Zimmermann et al., 2005</xref>). The generation of improved reagents for detecting syndecan-4, followed by high-resolution analyses of receptor distribution, is a high priority.</p>
      <p>The role of syndecan-4 as a sensor of tissue damage in vivo is now apparent, and identification of molecules downstream of syndecan-4 has allowed us to resolve the mechanism of fibroblast recruitment during tissue repair. <italic>Sdc4</italic>, <italic>RhoG</italic>, and <italic>Cav1</italic> null mice each share a wound healing defect that can be attributed to a loss of persistent fibroblast migration (<xref rid="fig6 fig7" ref-type="fig">Figures 6 and 7</xref>; <xref rid="bib9 bib12" ref-type="bibr">Echtermeyer et al., 2001; Grande-García et al., 2007</xref>). Although the fundamental roles of α<sub>5</sub>β<sub>1</sub>-integrin and Rac1 in development render null mice embryonic lethal, there is a clear role for these molecules in tissue repair. Expression of α<sub>5</sub>β<sub>1</sub>-integrin is induced upon wounding (<xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr">Hynes, 2002</xref>), and mice with a fibroblast-specific Rac1 deletion suffer healing delay, wound contraction, and fibroblast migration defects that are comparable to those observed in the <italic>Sdc4</italic><sup>−/−</sup> mouse (<xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr">Liu et al., 2009</xref>). The possibility of syndecan-4 modulating the behavior of integrin and Rac1, without the deleterious side effects associated with targeting the molecules directly, makes syndecan-4 an attractive target for wound treatment.</p>

        <p>Engagement of Syndecan-4 Reduces Cell Avidity for Fibronectin</p>
        <p>(A) Individual, cantilever-mounted fibroblasts were contacted with fibronectin fragment-coated surfaces and then retracted.</p>
        <p>(B) During retraction, deflection of the calibrated cantilever was recorded to obtain measurements of the maximum applicable force, number of individual tethers, and the total work required to detach the cell from the substrate.</p>
        <p>(C) ELISA analysis of coated ligands to ensure equivalent density of integrin-binding motifs between the integrin-binding fragment of fibronectin (50K, closed bars) and fibronectin (open bars).</p>
        <p>(D) Unbinding force curves as a fibroblast was withdrawn from 50K or fibronectin in the absence or presence of a soluble syndecan-4-binding fragment of fibronectin (H/0).</p>
        <p>(E and F) Quantification of the energy (E) or maximum force (F) required to detach a fibroblast.</p>
        <p>(G) H/0, preincubated with 10 μg/ml heparin, was used as an inactivated syndecan-4 ligand.</p>
        <p>(H–J) The specific role of syndecan-4 was tested by comparing responses of syndecan-4 null MEFs (H), wild-type MEFs (I), and null MEFs reexpressing the syndecan-4 cDNA (J).</p>
        <p>(K) Individual unbinding energy measurements as fibroblasts were contacted sequentially with 50K (circles), fibronectin (crosses), and then 50K again. Graph depicts pooled data from three separate cells.</p>
        <p>(L) Time course of unbinding energy from 50K upon addition of soluble H/0.</p>
        <p>All values represent at least 80 measurements per condition from five to nine experiments. Error bars represent standard error of the mean; significance was tested by ANOVA. See also <xref rid="app2" ref-type="sec">Figure S1</xref>.</p>

        <p>Syndecan-4 Engagement Drives Reduction of Cell Avidity through Dynamin-Dependent, Caveolin-Dependent Endocytosis of α<sub>5</sub>β<sub>1</sub>-Integrin</p>
        <p>(A, B, D, and E) The effect of syndecan-4 engagement on unbinding energy using fibroblasts transfected with control (Ctrl) (A), dynamin-2-targeted (Dnm2) (B), clathrin heavy-chain-targeted (D), or caveolin-1-targeted (E) siRNA. Western blots compare expression of appropriate molecules between control and siRNA-transfected populations. Knockdown of caveolin-1 caused concomitant loss of caveolin-2, as previously reported (<xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr">Razani et al., 2001</xref>).</p>
        <p>(C) Unbinding energy of fibroblasts treated with soluble H/0, and subsequently treated with the dynamin inhibitor MiTMAB to block the endocytic signal.</p>
        <p>(F) Time-lapse TIRF imaging of β<sub>1</sub>-integrin-GFP in the adhesion plane, comparing MEFs transfected with control or caveolin-targeted RNAi oligos. Images represent 5 min pre- or post-H/0 stimulation. Scale bars represent 5 μm. Values represent at least 25 measurements per condition from 4 separate experiments. TIRF analysis summarizes intensity changes of 20 adhesions per cell, 9 cells per condition.</p>
