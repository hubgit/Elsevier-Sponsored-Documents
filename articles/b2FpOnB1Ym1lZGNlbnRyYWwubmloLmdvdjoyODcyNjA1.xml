        <title>Summary</title>
        <sec>
          <p>We describe a mechanism of tumorigenesis mediated by kinase-dead BRAF in the presence of oncogenic RAS. We show that drugs that selectively inhibit BRAF drive RAS-dependent BRAF binding to CRAF, CRAF activation, and MEK–ERK signaling. This does not occur when oncogenic BRAF is inhibited, demonstrating that BRAF inhibition per se does not drive pathway activation; it only occurs when BRAF is inhibited in the presence of oncogenic RAS. Kinase-dead BRAF mimics the effects of the BRAF-selective drugs and kinase-dead Braf and oncogenic Ras cooperate to induce melanoma in mice. Our data reveal another paradigm of BRAF-mediated signaling that promotes tumor progression. They highlight the importance of understanding pathway signaling in clinical practice and of genotyping tumors prior to administering BRAF-selective drugs, to identify patients who are likely to respond and also to identify patients who may experience adverse effects.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>The RAS–ERK (extracellular-signal regulated protein kinase) MAPK (mitogen-activated protein kinase) signaling pathway regulates cell responses to environmental cues (<xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr">Marshall, 1995</xref>) and plays an important role in human cancer (<xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">Gray-Schopfer et al., 2007</xref>). The pathway comprises the RAS small guanine-nucleotide binding protein and the protein kinases RAF, MEK (mitogen and extracellular-regulated protein kinase kinase), and ERK. RAS is attached to the inner face of the plasma membrane and is activated downstream of growth factor, cytokine, and hormone receptors. Active RAS recruits RAF to the membrane for activation through a complex process involving changes in phosphorylation and binding to other enzymes and scaffold proteins (<xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr">Kolch, 2000</xref>). RAF phosphorylates and activates MEK, which phosphorylates and activates ERK.</p>
      <p>The complexity of this pathway is increased by the multiplicity of its components. There are three <italic>RAS</italic> (<italic>HRAS</italic>, <italic>NRAS</italic>, and <italic>KRAS</italic>), three <italic>RAF</italic> (<italic>ARAF</italic>, <italic>BRAF</italic>, and <italic>CRAF</italic>), two <italic>MEK</italic> (<italic>MEK1</italic> and <italic>MEK2</italic>), and two <italic>ERK</italic> (<italic>ERK1</italic> and <italic>ERK2</italic>) genes that encode proteins with nonredundant functions. Furthermore, the pathway is not linear. BRAF binds to and activates CRAF in a RAS-dependent manner that appears to require CRAF transphosphorylation by BRAF (<xref rid="bib9 bib24 bib29" ref-type="bibr">Garnett et al., 2005; Rushworth et al., 2006; Weber et al., 2001</xref>), providing subtle pathway regulation that is not fully understood. ERK phosphorylates many substrates and the duration and intensity of its activity affects how cells respond to extracellular signals (<xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr">Marshall, 1995</xref>). Thus, the pathway must be carefully controlled to ensure appropriate responses to environmental cues. In normal cells, outcomes include survival, proliferation, senescence, and differentiation, but in cancer the constitutive pathway activation favors proliferation and survival.</p>
      <p>RAS–ERK signaling is particularly important in melanoma. Somatic mutations occur in <italic>BRAF</italic>, <italic>NRAS</italic>, and <italic>KRAS</italic> in 43%, 20%, and 2% of melanomas respectively (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.sanger.ac.uk/genetics/CGP/cosmic/">www.sanger.ac.uk/genetics/CGP/cosmic/</ext-link>). The mutations in RAS trap it in a GTP-bound, active conformation and mostly involve glycine 12 (G12), glycine 13 (G13), and glutamine 61 (Q61). A glutamic acid substitution for the valine at position 600 (<sup>V600E</sup>BRAF) accounts for over 90% of the mutations in BRAF in cancer. However, over 100 other rare mutations have been described, most of which cluster to the glycine-rich loop and activation segment in the kinase domain. These regions normally trap BRAF in an inactive conformation by forming an atypical intramolecular interaction, and it is thought that the mutations disrupt this interaction, thereby allowing the active conformation to prevail (<xref rid="bib28" ref-type="bibr">Wan et al., 2004</xref>).</p>
      <p>Functional studies have shown that most of the mutations in BRAF are activating and enhance its ability to directly phosphorylate MEK (<xref rid="bib28 bib8" ref-type="bibr">Wan et al., 2004; Garnett and Marais, 2004</xref>). Curiously however, some mutants have impaired activity and although they cannot directly phosphorylate MEK, they appear to retain sufficient activity to bind to and transphosphorylate and activate CRAF in a RAS-independent manner (<xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr">Garnett et al., 2005</xref>), allowing these mutants to activate the pathway indirectly through CRAF. More puzzling are mutations that occur at aspartic acid 594 (D594). The carboxy oxygen of this highly conserved residue (the “D” of the DFG motif) plays a critical role in chelating Mg<sup>2+</sup> and stabilizing ATP binding in the catalytic site (<xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr">Johnson et al., 1998</xref>). As in other kinases, mutation of this residue causes inactivation and thus cancer mutants such as <sup>D594V</sup>BRAF cannot phosphorylate MEK, activate CRAF, or stimulate cell signaling (<xref rid="bib13 bib28" ref-type="bibr">Ikenoue et al., 2003; Wan et al., 2004</xref>). These mutants therefore appear catalytically and biologically inactive and yet 34 have been found in human cancer (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.sanger.ac.uk/genetics/CGP/cosmic/">www.sanger.ac.uk/genetics/CGP/cosmic/</ext-link>). Furthermore, while <sup>V600E</sup>BRAF mutations (over 10,000 described) occur in a mutually exclusive manner with RAS mutations, four of the 34 kinase-dead mutants are coincident with RAS mutations, a highly significant enrichment (p &lt; 10<sup>−9</sup>; Fisher's Exact Test) that suggests functional interaction.</p>
      <p>It has been shown that <sup>V600E</sup>BRAF is 500-fold activated, can stimulates constitutive MEK–ERK signaling in cells (<xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">Gray-Schopfer et al., 2007</xref>) and induce melanoma in mice (<xref rid="bib2 bib3" ref-type="bibr">Dankort et al., 2009; Dhomen et al., 2009</xref>), showing that it can be a founder mutation in melanoma. Importantly, <sup>V600E</sup>BRAF inhibition blocks melanoma cell proliferation and induces apoptosis in vitro and blocks melanoma xenograft growth in vivo (see <xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">Gray-Schopfer et al., 2007</xref>). These data validate <sup>V600E</sup>BRAF as a driver of melanomagenesis and as a therapeutic target in melanoma, so drugs to target this pathway have been developed. The first to be tested clinically were the multi-kinase inhibitor sorafenib and the MEK inhibitor PD184352 (CI1040). Disappointingly, both failed to produce objective responses in patients, either because they were not sufficiently potent, or because they caused unacceptable toxicity (<xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr">Halilovic and Solit, 2008</xref>). Recently, more potent and selective BRAF inhibitors have been described. For example, the triarylimidazole SB590885 and the difluorophenylsulfonamine PLX4720 display excellent selectivity for BRAF in vitro and preferentially inhibit BRAF mutant cancer cell proliferation (<xref rid="bib16 bib27" ref-type="bibr">King et al., 2006; Tsai et al., 2008</xref>). More importantly, BRAF-selective drugs have recently entered the clinic and are producing excellent responses in patients with BRAF mutant melanoma (<xref rid="bib6 bib25" ref-type="bibr">Flaherty et al., 2009; Schwartz et al., 2009</xref>).</p>
      <p>The aim of this study was to better understand the responses that melanoma cells make to BRAF-selective inhibitors and thereby to provide a molecular basis for the design of clinical trials using BRAF drugs. We also wished to examine if kinase-dead BRAF and oncogenic RAS functionally interact in vivo.</p>

        <title>BRAF Inhibitors Activate MEK and ERK in RAS Mutant Melanoma Cells</title>
        <p>We selected four drugs for our studies (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Figures S1</xref>A–S1D). Sorafenib is a class II (inactive conformation binder) drug (<xref rid="bib28" ref-type="bibr">Wan et al., 2004</xref>) that inhibits <sup>V600E</sup>BRAF at 40 nM, CRAF at 13 nM, and several other kinases in the low nM range (<xref rid="bib30" ref-type="bibr">Wilhelm et al., 2004</xref>). It is the least-selective drug that we used. PLX4720 is a class I (active conformation binder) inhibitor that is highly selective and inhibits <sup>V600E</sup>BRAF at 13 nM (<xref rid="bib27" ref-type="bibr">Tsai et al., 2008</xref>). 885-A (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Figure S1</xref>C) is a close analog of the class I inhibitor SB590885 (<xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr">King et al., 2006</xref>) that is also highly selective for BRAF. It inhibits <sup>V600E</sup>BRAF at 2 nM (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Figure S1</xref>E), is ineffective against a panel of 64 other protein kinases (<xref rid="app1" ref-type="sec">Table S1</xref>), and preferentially blocks BRAF mutant cancer cell proliferation (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Figure S1</xref>F). Finally, we also used the potent and selective MEK inhibitor PD184352 (<xref rid="bib26" ref-type="bibr">Sebolt-Leopold et al., 1999</xref>).</p>
        <p>As expected, all four drugs blocked ERK activity in BRAF mutant A375 melanoma cells (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>A; see <xref rid="app1" ref-type="sec">Table S2</xref>). Similarly, all four drugs inhibited ERK in SkMel24, SkMel28, D25, and WM266.4 cells, another four lines that express mutant BRAF (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Figure S1</xref>G). We also tested the drugs in D04, MM415, MM485, and WM852 NRAS mutant cells (<xref rid="app1" ref-type="sec">Table S2</xref>). As expected, PD184352 and sorafenib inhibited ERK in all of these lines (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>A). Surprisingly, however, PLX4720 and 885-A caused an unexpected increase in ERK activity in the NRAS mutant cells (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>A). NRAS or CRAF depletion by RNA interference (RNAi) blocked MEK/ERK activation by PLX4720 and 885-A in NRAS mutant cells (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>B and 1C) and we show that 885-A activated CRAF in these cells (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>D). We previously reported that oncogenic RAS requires CRAF but not BRAF to activate MEK (<xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">Dumaz et al., 2006</xref>) and consistent with this, BRAF is inactive in NRAS mutant cells (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>E). These data therefore present an intriguing paradox. BRAF is not active and is not required for MEK/ERK activation in RAS mutant cells. Nevertheless, BRAF inhibitors hyperactivate CRAF and MEK in these cells, so we studied the underlying mechanism(s).</p>

        <title>RAF Inhibitors Induce BRAF Binding to CRAF in RAS Mutant Cells</title>
        <p>Wild-type BRAF binds to CRAF in a RAS-dependent manner and although this binding is weak, it leads to CRAF activation (<xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr">Garnett et al., 2005</xref>). Since RAS and CRAF are required for ERK activation by PLX4720 and 885-A, we investigated if these drugs induce BRAF binding to CRAF. Endogenous BRAF was immunoprecipitated from melanoma cells and western blotted for endogenous CRAF. We show that CRAF did not bind to BRAF in untreated or PD184352 treated WM852, D04, MM415, or MM485 cells (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>A), demonstrating that MEK inhibition does not induce binding. In contrast, sorafenib and 885-A induced strong binding of BRAF to CRAF in all four lines (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>A). We also performed the experiment in the inverse manner, immunoprecipitating CRAF and showing that BRAF binding was strongly induced by sorafenib and 885-A (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>A). Curiously, PLX4720 did not appear to induce BRAF binding to CRAF, but previous studies have shown that ERK phosphorylates BRAF in a negative-feedback loop that destabilizes its binding to CRAF (<xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr">Rushworth et al., 2006</xref>). We show that PD184352 stabilizes BRAF binding to CRAF in the presence of PLX4720 (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>B), demonstrating that PLX4720 does induce binding, albeit less strongly than the other drugs. In addition to inducing BRAF binding to CRAF in NRAS mutant cells, 885-A and sorafenib also induce this binding in WM1791c melanoma cells and in SW620 and HCT116 colorectal carcinoma cells (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>C), all of which express mutant <italic>KRAS</italic> (<xref rid="app1" ref-type="sec">Table S2</xref>). Importantly, no strong binding of BRAF to CRAF was seen in A375 cells even in the presence of PD184352 and the drugs did not induce strong BRAF binding to CRAF in two other BRAF mutant melanoma cell lines (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>D and <xref rid="fig9" ref-type="fig">Figure S2</xref>).</p>
      </sec>
      <sec id="sec2.3">
        <title>BRAF Binding to CRAF Is Mediated by RAS</title>
        <p>Thus, sorafenib, 885-A and PLX4720 all induced BRAF binding to CRAF in NRAS or KRAS mutant cells, but not in BRAF mutant cells, showing that BRAF inhibition per se did not induce this binding; it only occurred when BRAF was inhibited in the presence of oncogenic RAS. To confirm the essential role of RAS, we show that a CRAF mutant (<sup>R89L</sup>CRAF) that cannot bind to RAS (<xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">Fabian et al., 1994</xref>) did not bind to BRAF (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>A and <xref rid="fig10" ref-type="fig">Figure S3</xref>A) and the corresponding mutant of BRAF (<sup>R188L</sup>BRAF) did not bind to CRAF (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>B and see <xref rid="fig10" ref-type="fig">Figure S3</xref>B). We also prepared membrane/cytosol fractionations of RAS mutant cells and show that under normal conditions over 40% of CRAF is in the membrane, whereas BRAF is largely cytosolic (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>C). Notably, 885-A treatment leads to strong recruitment of BRAF to the membrane fraction, whereas CRAF is only weakly affected (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>C). We also show that under normal conditions, EGF did not induce BRAF binding to CRAF in PMWK cells, a line that is wild-type for <italic>BRAF</italic> and <italic>RAS</italic> (<xref rid="app1" ref-type="sec">Table S2</xref>). However, in the presence of 885-A, EGF induced robust binding of BRAF to CRAF in PMWK cells and this resulted in sustained pathway activation (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>D). This shows that BRAF binding to CRAF is induced in the presence of both oncogenic RAS and activated wild-type RAS.</p>
        <p>We note that sorafenib and 885-A induce a mobility shift in BRAF in SDS-gels (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>A). BRAF also undergoes a mobility shift in PLX4720 treated cells in the presence of PD184352 (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>B). This mobility shift is reduced when immunoprecipitated BRAF is treated with calf intestinal alkaline phosphatase (CIP; <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>E) and PD184352 pretreatment reduced, but did not ablate the magnitude of the shift induced by 885-A (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>F). Importantly, in vitro CIP treatment and cell pretreatment with PD184352 did not prevent BRAF binding to CRAF (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figures 3</xref>E and 3F). Together, these data suggest that the BRAF bound to CRAF is hyperphosphorylated through MEK–ERK-dependent and MEK–ERK-independent mechanisms, but that this phosphorylation is not required for BRAF binding to CRAF.</p>

        <title>BRAF Inhibition Activates CRAF</title>
        <p>To test directly if BRAF binding to CRAF is driven by 885-A binding to BRAF, we mutated the so-called “gatekeeper threonine” (T529) of BRAF to asparagine (T529N). Since BRAF is not active in RAS mutant melanoma cells (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>E), we measured <sup>T529N</sup>BRAF activity using transient expression in COS cells (<xref rid="bib28" ref-type="bibr">Wan et al., 2004</xref>). The results show that <sup>T529N</sup>BRAF is still activated by <sup>G12V</sup>HRAS, <sup>G12V</sup>NRAS and <sup>G12V</sup>KRAS (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>A and <xref rid="fig11" ref-type="fig">Figure S4</xref>A). Importantly, <sup>T529N</sup>BRAF is ∼170-fold less sensitive to 885-A than wild-type BRAF (17 nM versus 2869 nM; <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>B) and 885-A did not stimulate its binding to CRAF (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>C), proving that drug binding to BRAF drives BRAF binding to CRAF.</p>
        <p>Next, we expressed a kinase-dead version of BRAF (<sup>D594A</sup>BRAF) in D04 cells and show that it forms a constitutive complex with CRAF (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>D) and that it activates MEK constitutively (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>E, compare lanes 1, 4, and 7). Notably, 885-A does not further enhance MEK activation driven by <sup>D594A</sup>BRAF (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>E, compare lanes 4, 6 to 7, 9), presumably because it cannot further inhibit this already inactive kinase. Two other kinase-dead BRAF mutants, the classical catalytic lysine mutant (<sup>K483M</sup>BRAF), and <sup>D594V</sup>BRAF, a mutant found in human cancer (<xref rid="bib28" ref-type="bibr">Wan et al., 2004</xref>), also activate MEK in D04 cells (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>F). Thus, it is BRAF inhibition and not drug binding that drives BRAF binding to CRAF. This experiment also shows that MEK activation driven by kinase-dead BRAF is inhibited by sorafenib (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figures 4</xref>E and 4F). Indeed, cell responses to sorafenib appear to be paradoxical. We show that although sorafenib inhibits ERK (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>A), it induces BRAF binding to CRAF (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>A), CRAF activation (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>G) and CRAF phosphorylation on S338 (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>G, inset), a critical event in CRAF activation (<xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr">Mason et al., 1999</xref>). To test directly the role of CRAF in cells when BRAF is inhibited, we mutated its gatekeeper threonine to asparagine (<sup>T421N</sup>CRAF). Notably, <sup>T421N</sup>CRAF still binds to BRAF in sorafenib and 885-A treated cells (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>H), demonstrating that drug binding to CRAF is not required for BRAF binding to CRAF. More importantly, in the presence of <sup>T421N</sup>CRAF, sorafenib activates rather than inhibits the pathway (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>H, compare lanes 3 and 7). We therefore posit that sorafenib induces paradoxical activation of CRAF because it inhibits BRAF and drives CRAF activation, but simultaneously binds to and inhibits CRAF. In agreement with this model, we show that two other pan-RAF inhibitors, ZM336372 and RAF265 also induce BRAF binding to CRAF, but without activating ERK (see <xref rid="fig11" ref-type="fig">Figure S4</xref>B).</p>

        <title>Oncogenic Ras and Kinase-Dead Braf Cooperate to Induce Melanoma in Mice</title>
        <p>Our data establish that inhibition of BRAF in the presence of oncogenic RAS hyperactivates CRAF, MEK, and ERK. To investigate the consequences of this in vivo, we used conditionally targeted alleles of oncogenic Kras (<italic>Kras<sup>LSL-G12D</sup></italic>) and kinase-dead Braf (<italic>Braf<sup>LSL-D594A</sup></italic>) in transgenic mice. These alleles use Cre-recombinase/<italic>LoxP</italic>-Stop-<italic>LoxP</italic> (LSL) technology to regulate inducible expression of mutant proteins from the endogenous mouse genes to ensure normal levels of protein expression. The <italic>Kras<sup>LSL-G12D</sup></italic> allele has been described (<xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr">Jackson et al., 2001</xref>), and we recently developed the <italic>Braf<sup>LSL-D594A</sup></italic> allele. Briefly, exon 15 of endogenous <italic>Braf</italic> was targeted to mutate D594 to alanine (D594A; see <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref>A). To prevent expression of <sup>D594A</sup>Braf in all cells, an LSL cassette was inserted between exon 14 and the mutated exon 15. This contains a minigene for exons 15–18 of <sup>WT</sup>Braf, a transcription terminator and a <italic>Neo<sup>R</sup></italic> selection marker to ensure that only <sup>WT</sup>Braf is expressed. Removal of the LSL cassette by Cre-recombinase reveals the mutated exon 15 and <sup>D594A</sup>Braf is expressed. These mice were crossed to <italic>Tyr::CreERT2</italic> mice (<xref rid="bib32" ref-type="bibr">Yajima et al., 2006</xref>), in which the tyrosinase promoter is used to express tamoxifen-activated Cre-recombinase (CreERT2) in the melanocytes. Since CreERT2 is activated by tamoxifen, this approach provides exquisite spatial and temporal control over <sup>G12D</sup>Kras and <sup>D594A</sup>Braf expression.</p>
        <p><italic>Kras<sup>+/LSL-G12D</sup></italic>, <italic>Braf<sup>+/LSL-D594A</sup></italic>, and <italic>Tyr::CreERT2<sup>+/o</sup></italic> mice were crossed to generate <italic>Kras<sup>+/LSL-G12D</sup></italic>;<italic>Tyr::CreERT2<sup>+/o</sup></italic>, <italic>Braf<sup>+/LSL-D594A</sup></italic>;<italic>Tyr::CreERT2<sup>+/o</sup></italic>, or <italic>Kras<sup>+/LSL-G12D</sup></italic>;<italic>Braf<sup>+/LSL-D594A</sup></italic>;<italic>Tyr::CreERT2<sup>+/o</sup></italic> mice. In all cases, the conditionally targeted alleles were balanced over a corresponding wild-type allele. Mice were treated with tamoxifen at 2–3 months of age to induce mutant protein expression. We have recently shown that in this model, <sup>V600E</sup>Braf induces skin hyperpigmentation, nevus formation, and melanoma (<xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">Dhomen et al., 2009</xref>). In contrast, <sup>D594A</sup>Braf did not induce skin hyperpigmentation, nevi (data not shown) or tumors (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref>C). <sup>G12D</sup>Kras induced weak tail darkening after 5–6 months (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref>B) but did not induce either nevi (data not shown) or tumors (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref>C). However, when <sup>D594A</sup>Braf and <sup>G12D</sup>Kras were combined, they induced a conspicuous skin phenotype. Within 2–3 months the ears (data not shown), tails (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref>B), and paws (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref>D) darkened visibly. The mice did not develop nevi, but within 6 months, they all developed large, rapidly growing oligo-pigmented tumors (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figures 5</xref>C and 5E). The tumors displayed evidence of ulceration (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref>F) and were composed largely of spindle cells that exhibit features of malignancy, including cellular atypia, nuclear pleomorphism, and conspicuous nucleoli (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref>G). They were highly proliferative as evidenced by large numbers of mitotic figures in the superficial and deep aspects of the lesions (∼6 mitosis/10HPF; <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref>H) and positive staining for Ki67 throughout (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref>I).</p>
        <p>The tumors were strongly and diffusely positive for S100 (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6</xref>A) and expressed the melanocyte markers tyrosinase, Dct, Pax3, and silver (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6</xref>B), consistent with a diagnosis of melanoma. Genomic DNA analysis of the tumors and cell lines derived from them confirmed that <italic>Braf<sup>LSL-D594A</sup></italic> had been recombined to <italic>Braf<sup>Lox-D594A</sup></italic> (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6</xref>C). However, for technical reasons we could not detect <italic>Kras<sup>LSL-G12D</sup></italic> recombination (data not shown), so used RT-PCR to amplify and sequence Kras mRNA. We show that only wild-type Kras is expressed in the kidneys, whereas the tumors expressed both wild-type Kras and <sup>G12D</sup>Kras (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6</xref>D). Importantly, we show constitutive binding of Braf to Craf in cells from the <sup>G12D</sup>Kras/<sup>D594A</sup>Braf tumors (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6</xref>E). As a control, we used cells from melanoma induced by <sup>G12V</sup>Kras overexpression. Briefly, when <sup>G12V</sup>Kras was overexpressed in melanocytes in mice using the β-actin promoter (β-actin:LSL:<sup>G12V</sup>Kras; <xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr">Meuwissen et al., 2001</xref>), it induced rapid onset melanoma (median time to onset 2 months, 100% penetrance within 3 months) in the absence of <sup>D594A</sup>Braf (manuscript submitted). Importantly, in cells from these tumors, Braf does not bind to Craf (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6</xref>E). Thus, it is only kinase-dead Braf and not wild-type Braf that binds to Craf in the presence of oncogenic Kras.</p>

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>In this study, we show that inhibition of BRAF by chemical or genetic means in the presence of oncogenic or growth-factor activated RAS induces BRAF binding to CRAF, leading to CRAF hyperactivation and consequently elevated MEK and ERK signaling. The mechanism we describe is another paradigm of RAF activation downstream of RAS and based on our findings, we propose the following mechanism by which this occurs. We posit that in RAS mutant cells, BRAF maintains itself in an inactive conformation through its own kinase activity, either through auto-phosphorylation, or by phosphorylating a partner protein that then keeps it inactive (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7</xref>A). We are currently using mass-spectrometry and mutagenic approaches to elucidate the underlying mechanism. We propose that when BRAF is inhibited, it escapes this auto-inhibited state and is recruited to the plasma membrane by RAS, where it forms a stable complex with CRAF. Critically, we posit that because it is inhibited, BRAF does not directly phosphorylate MEK, but rather it acts as a scaffold whose function is to enhance CRAF activation, thereby allowing CRAF to hyperactivate the pathway (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7</xref>B). We do not know the stoichiometry of the components in these complexes, but since BRAF and CRAF must both bind to RAS for complex formation, it seems likely that at least two RAS proteins are needed to stimulate formation of the complex (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7</xref>B).</p>
      <p>It is unclear why PLX4720 only induces weak binding of BRAF to CRAF, but this may stem from its unique property of displacing the α-C helix of BRAF when it binds (<xref rid="bib27" ref-type="bibr">Tsai et al., 2008</xref>) and suggests that this helix is important for BRAF binding to CRAF, something that will only be resolved when the BRAF:CRAF crystal structure is solved. We have attempted to identify other proteins that may be required to stabilize the BRAF–CRAF complexes. Our unpublished mutagenesis data suggests that 14-3-3 is required to stabilize these drug-induced complexes (data not shown) and this is consistent with previous observations demonstrating that 14-3-3 mediates BRAF binding to CRAF (<xref rid="bib9 bib24" ref-type="bibr">Garnett et al., 2005; Rushworth et al., 2006</xref>). Although this appears to contradict our observation that dephosphorylation does not disrupt the complex, because 14-3-3 binds to BRAF and CRAF in a phosphorylation-dependent manner, we presume that 14-3-3 protects these sites from dephosphorylation. We have also used RNAi to examine the potential role of other proteins implicated in BRAF-CRAF complex formation or pathway activation, including the scaffold proteins KSR, Sprouty2 and RKTG and the small G protein RHEB, but our preliminary results have not revealed obvious roles for these proteins. Our studies have parallels to the recently described heterodimers between DRAF and KSR in <italic>Drosophila</italic> (<xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr">Rajakulendran et al., 2009</xref>). Notably, flies have only one RAF isoform and it appears to be an ortholog of BRAF rather than ARAF or CRAF. Our inability to demonstrate an obvious role for KSR in mediating BRAF binding to CRAF or CRAF activation by BRAF suggests that the mechanism underlying dimerization here may be different from those described in flies, but clearly additional studies are required to investigate further the role of scaffold proteins in mediating the phenomena we report.</p>
      <p>In contrast to the BRAF-selective inhibitors, the pan-RAF inhibitors appear to induce paradoxical activation of CRAF. They induce BRAF binding to CRAF and CRAF activation, but do not activate MEK–ERK signaling. We posit that this is because these agents target both BRAF and CRAF. Thus, although their inhibition of BRAF will stimulate CRAF activation, they will simultaneously inhibit CRAF (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7</xref>C). This model is supported by our observation that <sup>T421N</sup>CRAF converts sorafenib from a pathway inhibitor to a pathway activator and we argue that the paradoxical activation of CRAF by these inhibitors is mediated by BRAF, rather than disrupted feedback inhibition as previously suggested (<xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr">Hall-Jackson et al., 1999</xref>).</p>
      <p>Recently, paradoxical activation of PKB/AKT and PKCɛ was also described (<xref rid="bib1 bib22" ref-type="bibr">Cameron et al., 2009; Okuzumi et al., 2009</xref>). While ATP-competitive inhibition can block kinase function, they do not block the upstream events that activate the target kinase. For instance, PKB/AKT inhibitors block the function of this kinase, but occupation of the ATP-pocket by these inhibitors was sufficient to induce the priming phosphorylation usually required for its full activation (<xref rid="bib22" ref-type="bibr">Okuzumi et al., 2009</xref>). Inhibitor binding to PKCɛ has been shown to have a similar effect (<xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr">Cameron et al., 2009</xref>). Importantly, the paradoxical activation of PKB/AKT and PKCɛ did not result in pathway activation because of the continued presence of the inhibitors (<xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">Frye and Johnson, 2009</xref>). In contrast, although BRAF inhibitors also block BRAF kinase activity, this relieves auto-inhibition and results in BRAF hyperphosphorylation, BRAF binding to CRAF, pathway activation and oncogenesis, all presumably because BRAF can heterodimerize with CRAF. Our study also highlights the critical difference between BRAF-selective and pan-RAF drugs. Whereas BRAF-selective drugs cause pathway activation in a RAS-dependent manner, this does not occur with pan-RAF drugs.</p>
      <p>Our results provide important insight into the genetics of human cancer. Excluding V600 mutants, D594 mutants are the third most common in BRAF in cancer (34 out of 443 cases or ∼7.7%; <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.sanger.ac.uk/genetics/CGP/cosmic/">www.sanger.ac.uk/genetics/CGP/cosmic/</ext-link>). Furthermore, as mentioned in the Introduction, while <italic>BRAF</italic> and <italic>RAS</italic> mutations are generally mutually exclusive, 4 of the 34 (11.8%) tumors with D594 mutations also have mutations in RAS. This is a highly significant enrichment for the coincidence of these mutations (p &lt; 10<sup>−9</sup>; Fisher's Exact Test) and suggests a functional interaction. We now provide strong circumstantial evidence of such an interaction using transgenic mice. By themselves, <sup>D594A</sup>Braf and <sup>G12D</sup>Kras do not induce melanoma, but they cooperate to induce rapid onset melanoma. This highly significant result (p &lt; 0.0002) provides a rational explanation for the coincidence of these mutations in human cancer. Furthermore, we show that the BRAF inhibitors also hyperactivate this pathway in growth factor stimulated cells, providing an explanation of why kinase dead BRAF mutations are not always coincident with RAS mutations; presumably in some tumors the cooperating mutation is upstream of RAS.</p>
      <p>Our results also suggest several potential mechanisms by which resistance to RAF targeting drugs could develop in patients. BRAF mutant tumors could become resistant to BRAF-selective drugs, if they acquire a mutation in RAS or an upstream component that activates RAS, or if the drugs select a population of cells harboring pre-existing mutations in RAS. Theoretically this would cause BRAF-mediated CRAF activation, which may not only induce resistance, but could potentially promote tumor growth. In line with this, increased expression of CRAF can mediate acquired resistance to pan-RAF drugs in BRAF mutant cancer cells in vitro (<xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr">Montagut et al., 2008</xref>), establishing that CRAF can mediate resistance under some circumstances. Our in vitro studies also suggest that a potential mechanism of resistance in patients with RAS mutant tumors being treated with pan-RAF drugs is acquisition (or selection for cells with pre-existing mutations) of a CRAF mutation such as a gatekeeper mutant that prevents drug binding. Again this would potentially result in BRAF-mediated activation of CRAF (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7</xref>D) and possibly accelerated tumor growth.</p>
      <p>Although our studies are restricted to cell lines and transgenic mice, they do have important immediate clinical implications. They strongly argue that BRAF-selective inhibitors should not be administered to patients with RAS mutant tumors, because long-term use could accelerate tumor growth. Intriguingly, 10%–15% of patients treated with BRAF-selective drugs develop squamous cell carcinoma (SCC)(<xref rid="bib6 bib25" ref-type="bibr">Flaherty et al., 2009; Schwartz et al., 2009</xref>). Although MEK–ERK signaling has not yet been implicated in this response, 22% of SCCs harbour oncogenic mutations in <italic>RAS</italic> (9% <italic>HRAS</italic>, 8% <italic>NRAS</italic>, 5% <italic>KRAS</italic>: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.sanger.ac.uk/genetics/CGP/cosmic/">www.sanger.ac.uk/genetics/CGP/cosmic/</ext-link>), raising the intriguing possibility that the BRAF-selective drugs act as tumor promoters in premalignant skin cells harboring existing mutations in RAS and/or activation of upstream components that activate RAS.</p>
      <p>While sorafenib is equipotent for wild-type and <sup>V600E</sup>BRAF (<xref rid="bib30" ref-type="bibr">Wilhelm et al., 2004</xref>), the BRAF inhibitors we used are approximately 10-fold more active against <sup>V600E</sup>BRAF (<xref rid="bib16 bib27" ref-type="bibr">King et al., 2006; Tsai et al., 2008</xref>). Nevertheless, our data establish that they target wild-type BRAF in RAS mutant cells. The problem of mutant v.s. wild-type protein specificity is likely to be difficult to resolve, because whereas full inhibition of <sup>V600E</sup>BRAF may be necessary for clinical response in BRAF mutant tumors, activation of only a small proportion of wild-type BRAF could be sufficient to activate the pathway in RAS mutant cells. Thus, to achieve efficacy against <sup>V600E</sup>BRAF but avoid activation of wild-type BRAF in RAS mutant cells, the drugs will need to be exquisitely selective for the mutant protein. Alternatively, pan-RAF drugs may be effective because they will target both <sup>V600E</sup>BRAF and CRAF activated by BRAF in RAS mutant tumors. Furthermore, our data suggest that CRAF or MEK selective drugs should be used in RAS mutant tumors, because they do not induce BRAF-CRAF complexes and will not activate the pathway if the tumors acquire mutations such as <sup>T421N</sup>CRAF that block drug binding. Perhaps RAF and MEK inhibitors should be combined to provide the best responses and prevent emergence of resistance, but these issues need to be balanced against the urgency of the clinical problem being addressed.</p>
      <p>In summary, we show that inhibition of BRAF in RAS mutant cancer cells leads to MEK hyperactivation through CRAF. We have elucidated another mechanism by which BRAF activates MEK–ERK signaling, not only to drive tumorigenesis and tumor progression, but also potentially to allow development of de novo or acquired resistance to RAF-targeted therapies. Clearly, BRAF is a remarkably versatile oncogene that can promote MEK–ERK activation and tumor progression through several mechanisms and these will require different therapeutic strategies for effective disease management. Notably, many of the mutations that occur in other kinases in cancer are also predicted to cause inactivation (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.sanger.ac.uk/genetics/CGP/cosmic/">www.sanger.ac.uk/genetics/CGP/cosmic/</ext-link>). Our data raise the possibility that these could also act as idiosyncratic gain-of-function mutations that drive tumorigenesis. This study also raises important clinical questions and highlights the importance of fully understanding how signaling networks function to fully comprehend how patients may respond to targeted drugs. They also highlight the importance of genetic screening for patients, not only to identify those who are likely to respond, but to exclude those who could experience adverse effects and thereby ensure successful implementation of personalized medicine.</p>

                <title>Expression Constructs</title>
                <p>The expression vectors for wild-type human CRAF and wild-type human BRAF, pEFm/CRAF and pEFm/BRAF respectively have been described (Marais et al., 1995). Briefly, the vector backbone is pUC19 and the elongation factor 1α (EF1α) promoter is used to drive exogenous protein expression. The vector includes the first intron from human EF1α to assist mRNA processing during expression. The β-globin 5′ and 3′ untranslated regions (UTRs) are used to provide a strong translation start site (5′ UTR), and also to provide mRNA stability and a poly adenylation signal (3′ UTR). The vector introduces an amino-terminal myc-epitope tag (EQKLISEEDL) onto the exogenously expressed protein. The BRAF coding region includes the alternatively spliced exons 1 and 2 but not exons 8b or 10a and various modifications were introduced to provide additional restriction sites (without changing the amino acid sequence) and alterations to the 3′-UTR to allow easier manipulation of this construct. Standard PCR-directed mutagenesis approaches were used to generate the various mutations used in the study and all mutations were verified by automated dideoxy sequencing. The expression vector pMCEF/FLAG/CRAF uses the same expression cassette, but the backbone also possesses a neo resistance cassette to facilitate selection in the presence of G418. In addition, a version of this vector was used that incorporates a FLAG (DYKDDDKGS), rather than a myc-epitope tag.</p>

African green monkey kidney COS-7 cells were cultured in DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. All cell lines were incubated at 37°C and 10% CO<sub>2</sub>. For inhibitor treatment, the drugs were dissolved in DMSO and added to the medium for 2-5 hr. When two compounds were used, the first was added 30 min prior to the second. For cell growth assays, cells were seeded in 96-well plates and treated with drug in quadruplicate in a 10-point titration assay for 5 days. The amount of growth (% DMSO controls) was determined using sulphorhodamine B reagent (Monks et al., 1991) as follows. 1,000-10,000 cells (depending on cell type) were plated into 96-well plates in 100 μL medium. After 24 hr, compounds prepared in DMSO (10mM stocks) were serially diluted in culture medium at 2× the final required concentrations and 100μL were added to the cells to nine final concentrations of 0.005 μM-100 μM. After a further 5 days, the cells are fixed in trichloroacteic acid (10%), and stained with sulforhodamine-B (0.1%). After rinsing, the bound stain was disolved using 100 μL 10 mM Tris (pH 8.0) and the absorbance at 540 nm determined.

ERK activation was quantified by measuring the incorporation of [<sup>32</sup>P]-orthophosphate (PerkinElmer) into MBP. For measurement of endogenous BRAF kinase activity, D04 or A375 cells were seeded in 10cm dishes and harvested in 300 μl of NP40 buffer (<xref rid="app1" ref-type="sec">Table S3</xref>) as described above.

The reaction supernatants were collected from the beads and transferred into fresh tubes for the second step reaction. 5 μl of supernatant was incubated with 25 μl MBP buffer containing [γ-<sup>32</sup>P]ATP (PerkinElmer) for ten minutes at 30°C in triplicate to measure ERK activity. The second reaction was terminated by spotting 20 μl of reaction mix onto a 1cm<sup>2</sup> piece of P81 paper (VWR International), which was then dropped into 400ml 25mM orthophosphate solution. The papers were washed three times in 400 ml 25 mM orthophosphate solution to remove the unincorporated ATP and the [<sup>32</sup>P]-orthophosphate incorporated into MBP was determined using Cerenkov counting. For transfected samples, the background counts were determined using lysates of cells transfected with the empty vector.

        <p>A Model of Paradoxical CRAF Activation by BRAF</p>
        <p>(A) In the presence of oncogenic RAS, BRAF is cytosolic, where it maintains itself in an inactive conformation in a manner that depends on its own kinase activity. CRAF is recruited to the plasma membrane by RAS and activates the pathway.</p>
        <p>(B) When BRAF is inhibited by genetic or chemical means, it is no longer autoinhibited and is recruited to the plasma membrane by RAS, where it binds to CRAF. Although BRAF does not itself signal, it can act as a scaffold to enhance CRAF activity and consequently enhance signaling through the pathway.</p>
        <p>(C) Pan-RAF inhibitors hyperactivate CRAF because they inhibit BRAF, but they simultaneously inhibit CRAF, leading to paradoxical activation of CRAF without pathway activation.</p>
        <p>(D) <sup>T421N</sup>CRAF (T421N) escapes the paradoxical activation by the pan-RAF inhibitors, because it no longer allows them to bind, so is freely activated due to BRAF inhibition.</p>

        <p>(A) Myc-epitope tagged CRAF or <sup>R89L</sup>CRAF (R89L), or an empty vector control (EV) were transfected into D04 cells. After 48 hr the cells were treated with DMSO (-) or sorafenib (SF, +; 10 μM) for 4 hr. The myc-CRAF was immunoprecipitated (IP) and the immunocomplexes were western blotted (WB) for endogenous BRAF or myc-CRAF. Endogenous BRAF and myc-CRAF levels in the cell lysates are also shown.</p>
        <p>(B) Myc-epitope tagged BRAF or <sup>R188L</sup>BRAF (R188L) or an empty vector control (EV) were transfected into D04 cells. After 48 hr the cells were treated with DMSO (-) or sorafenib (SF, +; 10 μM) for 4 hr. The myc-BRAF was immunoprecipitated (IP) and the immunocomplexes were western blotted (WB) for myc-BRAF or endogenous CRAF. Myc-BRAF and endogenous-CRAF levels in the cell lysates are also shown.</p>

        <p>Characterization of <sup>T529N</sup>BRAF and the pan-RAF Inhibitors ZM336372 and RAF265, Relates to <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref></p>
        <p>(A) <sup>T529N</sup>BRAF is activated by NRAS and KRAS. COS cells were transiently transfected with myc-epitope tagged BRAF, or <sup>T529N</sup>BRAF (T529N) in the presence of <sup>G12V</sup>NRAS or <sup>G12V</sup>KRAS as indicated. BRAF kinase activity was measured in an immunoprecipitation kinase assay. The data represent one assay performed in triplicate, with error bars to represent standard deviations from the mean. Activity (%) is relative to wild-type BRAF activated by <sup>G12V</sup>NRAS or <sup>G12V</sup>KRAS as appropriate.</p>
        <p>(B) Pan-RAF inhibitors drive BRAF binding to CRAF but not ERK activation. DO4 cells were treated with ZM336372 or RAF265 for 4 hr. CRAF (IP: CRAF) was immunoprecipitated and the immnocomplexes were western blotted (WB) for BRAF or CRAF. BRAF and CRAF levels in the cell lysates are shown and the lysates were also western blotted for phosphorylated ERK (ppERK) and total ERK2.</p>
