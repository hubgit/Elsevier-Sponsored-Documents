        <title>Summary</title>
        <p>Muscarinic receptor activation facilitates the induction of synaptic plasticity and enhances cognitive function. However, the specific muscarinic receptor subtype involved and the critical intracellular signaling pathways engaged have remained controversial. Here, we show that the recently discovered highly selective allosteric M<sub>1</sub> receptor agonist 77-LH-28-1 facilitates long-term potentiation (LTP) induced by theta burst stimulation at Schaffer collateral synapses in the hippocampus. Similarly, release of acetylcholine by stimulation of cholinergic fibers facilitates LTP via activation of M<sub>1</sub> receptors. N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDAR) opening during theta burst stimulation was enhanced by M<sub>1</sub> receptor activation, indicating this is the mechanism for LTP facilitation. M<sub>1</sub> receptors were found to enhance NMDAR activation by inhibiting SK channels that otherwise act to hyperpolarize postsynaptic spines and inhibit NMDAR opening. Thus, we describe a mechanism where M<sub>1</sub> receptor activation inhibits SK channels, allowing enhanced NMDAR activity and leading to a facilitation of LTP induction in the hippocampus.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>The cholinergic system in the brain plays a major role in learning and memory through activation of muscarinic acetylcholine receptors (mAChRs). Antagonists of mAChRs, such as scopolamine, impair the encoding of new memories in animal models of learning and memory (<xref rid="bib15 bib54" ref-type="bibr">De Rosa and Hasselmo, 2000; Warburton et al., 2003</xref>) and produce cognitive impairment in humans (<xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">Atri et al., 2004</xref>). mAChR agonists and antagonists also modulate the induction of synaptic plasticity in the hippocampus, a cellular correlate for learning and memory. Both the endogenous release of acetylcholine in vivo (<xref rid="bib33 bib43" ref-type="bibr">Leung et al., 2003; Ovsepian et al., 2004</xref>) and the exogenous application of mAChR agonists in vitro facilitate the induction of long-term potentiation (LTP) (<xref rid="bib9 bib49 bib50" ref-type="bibr">Boddeke et al., 1992; Shimoshige et al., 1997; Shinoe et al., 2005</xref>). It is, therefore, tempting to infer that activation of mAChRs by release of acetylcholine in the hippocampus facilitates the induction of synaptic plasticity leading to cognitive enhancement.</p>
      <p>Of the five mAChR subtypes potentially involved in cognitive enhancement, the M<sub>1</sub> subtype has received much attention because of its ubiquitous expression in the cortex and hippocampus. Learning, working memory, and the induction of synaptic plasticity are all impaired in M<sub>1</sub> receptor knockout mice (<xref rid="bib2 bib50 bib55" ref-type="bibr">Anagnostaras et al., 2003; Shinoe et al., 2005; Wess, 2004</xref>). Furthermore, putative M<sub>1</sub> receptor-specific agonists improve cognitive function in animal models (<xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr">Dean et al., 2003</xref>) and facilitate LTP induction (<xref rid="bib9 bib48" ref-type="bibr">Boddeke et al., 1992; Seol et al., 2007</xref>) although the selectivity of these agonists remains unclear. A new group of allosteric agonists potentially offers greater subtype specificity, e.g., AC-42 at M<sub>1</sub> receptors (<xref rid="bib32" ref-type="bibr">Langmead et al., 2006</xref>) and LY2033298 at M<sub>4</sub> receptors (<xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr">Chan et al., 2008</xref>). An AC-42 derivative, 77-LH-28-1, has subsequently been developed that penetrates the brain and exhibits full agonist activity at M<sub>1</sub> receptors (<xref rid="bib31" ref-type="bibr">Langmead et al., 2008</xref>).</p>
      <p>mAChR activation could facilitate LTP induction by direct enhancement of N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor (NMDAR) opening (<xref rid="bib3 bib26 bib37 bib39" ref-type="bibr">Aramakis et al., 1999; Harvey et al., 1993; Marino et al., 1998; Markram and Segal, 1992</xref>) and/or reduced attenuation of back-propagating action potentials (<xref rid="bib53" ref-type="bibr">Tsubokawa and Ross, 1997</xref>). mAChRs also inhibit potassium channels, such as KCNQ channels, which results in an increased input resistance. In addition, recent evidence suggests that ion channels at postsynaptic spines work in unison with neurotransmitter receptors, enzymes, and other protein partners, thus creating multiprotein functional units (<xref rid="bib1 bib7" ref-type="bibr">Allen et al., 2007; Bildl et al., 2004</xref>). One such example is the small conductance voltage-independent and calcium-dependent SK channels that form feedback loops with NMDARs and ultimately shape excitatory post-synaptic potentials (EPSPs) and the induction of LTP (<xref rid="bib6 bib8 bib19 bib20 bib23 bib42" ref-type="bibr">Behnisch and Reymann, 1998; Bloodgood and Sabatini, 2007; Faber, 2010; Faber et al., 2005; Gu et al., 2008; Ngo-Anh et al., 2005</xref>).</p>
      <p>Here, we find that the specific M<sub>1</sub> receptor agonist 77-LH-28-1 facilitates LTP at the Schaffer collateral synapse. Importantly, our data indicate that M<sub>1</sub> activation leads to a previously unknown dynamic regulation of SK channel activity and subsequent modulation of NMDAR opening in response to synaptic activation. We conclude that the inhibition of SK channels is a critical link between M<sub>1</sub> receptor activation and the facilitation of LTP.</p>

        <title>The Cellular and Synaptic Effects of M<sub>1</sub> Receptor Activation</title>
        <p>To study the role of the M<sub>1</sub> receptor in synaptic plasticity, we made use of the recently discovered selective M<sub>1</sub> receptor agonist 77-LH-28-1 (1-[3-(4-butyl-1-piperidinyl)propyl]-3,4-dihydro-2[1H]-quinolinone). This compound is an allosteric agonist exhibiting &gt;100-fold specificity for M<sub>1</sub> over other mAChR subtypes. We have previously shown that 10 μM 77-LH-28-1 selectively activates M<sub>1</sub> receptors in cell lines expressing specific human mAChRs and in rat hippocampal slices (<xref rid="bib31" ref-type="bibr">Langmead et al., 2008</xref>).</p>
        <p>We first characterized the effects of 77-LH-28-1 on CA1 pyramidal cells examining both membrane properties and glutamatergic synaptic transmission in the Schaffer collateral pathway. These actions were compared to those of the nonselective cholinergic agonist carbachol. Whole-cell patch clamp recordings were made from visually identified CA1 pyramidal neurons in hippocampal slices. In current clamp mode, bath application of 1 μM carbachol caused a depolarization of 2.6 ± 0.8 mV (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figures 1</xref>A and 1D; n = 8, p &lt; 0.05) and elicited an increase in the input resistance of 32 ± 8 MΩ (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figures 1</xref>A and 1E; 206 ± 20 MΩ to 234 ± 15 MΩ, n = 8, p &lt; 0.05). The mean resting membrane potential was −75 ± 1 mV (n = 15). A similar depolarization and increase in input resistance was seen with bath application of 10 μM 77-LH-28-1 that reversed with washout (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figures 1</xref>B, 1D, and 1E; 1.9 ± 0.2 mV, p &lt; 0.05, and 44 ± 7 MΩ, p &lt; 0.05, n = 6). The depolarization and increase in input resistance were concentration-dependent for both carbachol and 77-LH-28-1. Application of 0.5 μM carbachol failed to produce a statistically significant depolarization of the membrane potential (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>D; −0.1 ± 1.3 mV, n = 6, p &gt; 0.05) or increase in input resistance (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>E; 18 ± 13 MΩ, n = 6, p &gt; 0.05), and 3 μM 77-LH-28-1 also failed to significantly depolarize the membrane potential (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>D; 1.3 ± 0.8 mV, n = 5, p &gt; 0.05) or produce a significant increase in input resistance (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>E; 14 ± 9 MΩ, n = 5, p &gt; 0.05).</p>
        <p>The effects of 77-LH-28-1 on the cellular properties of CA1 pyramidal cells were blocked by addition of the M<sub>1</sub> receptor antagonist pirenzepine, again in a concentration-dependent manner. Application of 3 μM pirenzepine reduced the depolarization induced by 10 μM 77-LH-28-1 to 0.5 ± 0.7 mV (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>D; n = 8, p &gt; 0.05) and the increase in input resistance to 9 ± 2 MΩ (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>E; n = 8, p &lt; 0.05). Application of 25 μM pirenzepine reduced the depolarization to −1 ± 1 mV and the increase in input resistance to 5 ± 4 MΩ (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figures 1</xref>C, 1D, and 1E; n = 4, p &gt; 0.05). The effects of carbachol and 77-LH-28-1 on the cellular properties of CA1 pyramidal cells are therefore similar.</p>
        <p>The specificity of 77-LH-28-1 was verified in mice lacking the M<sub>1</sub> receptor. Application of 10 μM 77-LH-28-1 produced a 3.9 ± 3 mV depolarization of the membrane potential in slices prepared from M<sub>1</sub>+/+ mice (n = 5, p &lt; 0.05) but no depolarization in slices from M<sub>1</sub>−/− mice (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>F; 0.7 ± 0.5 mV, n = 8, p &gt; 0.05). The mean resting membrane potential in cells from either set of animals prior to agonist application was not significantly different (−70 ± 2 mV and −71 ± 1 mV for +/+ and −/− mice, respectively, p &gt; 0.05). Similarly, 77-LH-28-1 produced a 16 ± 3 MΩ increase in input resistance in slices prepared from M<sub>1</sub>+/+ mice (n = 6, p &lt; 0.05) that was abolished in slices from M<sub>1</sub>−/− mice (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>G; 6 ± 3 MΩ, n = 8, p &gt; 0.05). These results further illustrate the specificity of 77-LH-28-1 for the M<sub>1</sub> receptor.</p>
        <p>It is known that activation of cholinergic receptors in hippocampal slices induces short- and long-term changes in synaptic transmission, depending on the precise recording conditions and agonist used (<xref rid="bib5 bib18 bib21 bib38 bib49" ref-type="bibr">Auerbach and Segal, 1996; Dickinson et al., 2009; Fernández de Sevilla et al., 2008; Markram and Segal, 1990; Shimoshige et al., 1997</xref>). This has been attributed by various groups to activation of nicotinic or muscarinic receptors. Therefore, we next examined the effects of muscarinic receptor activation on synaptic transmission. By maintaining CA1 pyramidal cells in voltage clamp and recording excitatory postsynaptic currents (EPSCs) in response to stimulation of Schaffer collateral axons, we found that application of 1 μM carbachol induced a depression in EPSC amplitude (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>H; 58% ± 6% of baseline 15–20 min after application, n = 5, p &lt; 0.05). If the concentration of carbachol was raised to 5 μM, the EPSC depression increased (41% ± 9% of baseline, n = 5, p &lt; 0.05, data not shown), and lowering it to 0.5 μM decreased the depression (71% ± 9%, n = 7, p &lt; 0.05, data not shown). In contrast, 10 μM 77-LH-28-1 had no significant effect on EPSCs (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>I; 81% ± 10% of baseline 15–20 min after application, n = 7, p &gt; 0.05) while still increasing the input resistance of the postsynaptic cell (31 ± 11 MΩ, n = 7, p &lt; 0.05). This indicates that the depolarizing action of acetylcholine is due to M<sub>1</sub> receptor activation, but the effects on synaptic transmission are due to activation of nicotinic receptors or mAChRs other than M<sub>1</sub>. The specificity of 77-LH-28-1 enabled us to examine the role of M<sub>1</sub> receptors in synaptic plasticity since 77-LH-28-1 had limited effects on baseline synaptic transmission.</p>

        <title>M<sub>1</sub> Receptors Facilitate Induction of LTP in the Hippocampus</title>
        <p>We next investigated the role of selective M<sub>1</sub> receptor activation on LTP induced by a theta burst pairing (TBP) protocol. We have previously shown this protocol does not induce LTP when EPSP amplitude is kept below threshold for the initiation of action potentials but can induce LTP when EPSPs are suprathreshold (<xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr">Buchanan and Mellor, 2007</xref>), indicating that TBP with subthreshold EPSP amplitudes is just below the threshold for LTP induction. In the experiments described here, synaptic strength was recorded in voltage clamp in two independent Schaffer collateral pathways. In current clamp, TBP was then applied by pairing stimulation to one of the input pathways with initiation of back-propagating action potentials (b-APs, 2 ms current injections of amplitude 2 nA) in the postsynaptic cell. Recordings were then returned to voltage clamp mode to measure the EPSC amplitude in the two input pathways. Importantly, two input pathways were used in all plasticity experiments to ensure that the application of cholinergic agonists did not cause any nonspecific changes in synaptic strength. In addition, in all experiments, baseline EPSC amplitudes were small (mean 10 ± 3 pA, n = 12) to avoid suprathreshold summation of EPSPs during TBP (mean EPSP summation 6.1 ± 1.4 mV, mean resting potential −71 ± 2 mV, n = 12) (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>A; see <xref rid="sec4" ref-type="sec">Experimental Procedures</xref> for full description of induction protocol). In agreement with our previous results, no LTP was induced by TBP (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>B; 126% ± 10% control versus 136% ± 20% test pathway, n = 12, p &gt; 0.05). In contrast, in the presence of 10 μM 77-LH-28-1, robust pathway-specific LTP was induced (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>C; 105% ± 16% control versus 243% ± 56% test pathway, n = 7, p &lt; 0.05). The action of 77-LH-28-1 was specific for M<sub>1</sub> receptors because addition of pirenzepine (25 μM) prevented the induction of LTP (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>D; 91% ± 17% control versus 85% ± 16% test pathway, n = 7, p &gt; 0.05).</p>
        <p>The experiments were repeated at near physiological temperatures (35°C) to check that the effects were not specific to room temperature conditions. In control conditions, TBP did not produce a significant increase in EPSC amplitude (<xref rid="app2" ref-type="sec">Figure S1</xref>A, available online; 103% ± 13% control versus 107% ± 17% test pathway, n = 7, p &gt; 0.05). In the presence of 10 μM 77-LH-28-1, LTP was similar in amplitude to that found at room temperature (<xref rid="app2" ref-type="sec">Figure S1</xref>B; 94% ± 4% control versus 358% ± 34% test pathway, n = 8, p &lt; 0.01).</p>
        <p>We also investigated the facilitation of LTP by 77-LH-28-1 using field potential recordings from hippocampal slices. Stimulation of the Schaffer collateral pathway with a theta burst protocol, consisting of 10 bursts at a frequency of 5 Hz where each burst consisted of five pulses at 100 Hz, produced a small but significant LTP (<xref rid="app2" ref-type="sec">Figure S1</xref>C; 113% ± 4%, n = 7, p &lt; 0.05). In the presence of 77-LH-28-1, the amount of LTP was increased to 135% ± 7% (n = 6, p &lt; 0.05), demonstrating that M<sub>1</sub> receptor activation facilitates LTP in agreement with previous reports (<xref rid="bib43 bib50" ref-type="bibr">Ovsepian et al., 2004; Shinoe et al., 2005</xref>). When a maximal LTP protocol was employed, consisting of the theta burst protocol repeated three times with an interval of 10 s, this induced a larger LTP, and M<sub>1</sub> receptor activation was unable to facilitate LTP (<xref rid="app2" ref-type="sec">Figure S1</xref>D; 133% ± 11% control versus 137% ± 5% 77-LH-28-1, n = 6 and 6).</p>
        <p>We next tested whether the release of endogenous acetylcholine from cholinergic fibers in the hippocampus could activate M<sub>1</sub> receptors on CA1 pyramidal cells and facilitate the induction of LTP. Stimulation of cholinergic fibers in stratum oriens (four stimuli at 100 Hz) in the presence of the glutamatergic and GABAergic antagonists NBQX (1 μM), D-AP5 (50 μM), LY341495 (100 μM), picrotoxin (50 μM), and CGP55845 (1 μM) resulted in long-lasting mAChR-mediated EPSPs that were similar in amplitude and duration to those seen by other researchers (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>A) (<xref rid="bib14 bib50" ref-type="bibr">Cole and Nicoll, 1983; Shinoe et al., 2005</xref>). mAChR-mediated EPSPs were completely blocked by pirenzepine (25 μM), demonstrating the role of M<sub>1</sub> receptors (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>A). The average amplitude and duration of mAChR-mediated EPSPs was 24 ± 4 mV and 19 ± 1 s (n = 5, pirenzepine blocked on average 100% ± 2% of the response). To test the role of the mAChR-mediated EPSP in gating LTP, we omitted the glutamatergic and GABA<sub>B</sub> receptor antagonists and stimulated the stratum oriens 2 s before TBP to ensure that the mAChR-mediated EPSP was maximal during the induction protocol (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>B). Stimulation of the stratum oriens enabled the induction of substantial pathway-specific LTP (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>C; 121% ± 8% control versus 208% ± 44% test pathway, n = 15, p &lt; 0.05), and this was shown to result from M<sub>1</sub> receptor activation because the effect was blocked by bath application of pirenzepine (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>D; 123% ± 30% control versus 149% ± 31% test pathway, n = 8, p &gt; 0.05). The average peak amplitude of the mAChR-mediated EPSP during the LTP induction protocol was 5.0 ± 1.5 mV with a range of 1 to 22 mV. However, there was no correlation between the amount of LTP induced and the amplitude of the mAChR-mediated EPSP during LTP induction (data not shown).</p>

        <title>M<sub>1</sub> Receptor Enhancement of NMDAR-Mediated EPSCs Is Indirect and Voltage Dependent</title>
        <p>Reports in the literature indicate NMDAR function is modulated by mAChRs (<xref rid="bib3 bib26 bib37 bib38 bib39" ref-type="bibr">Aramakis et al., 1999; Harvey et al., 1993; Marino et al., 1998; Markram and Segal, 1990, 1992</xref>). This suggests that enhancement of NMDAR activation by mAChRs could be the mechanism for the facilitation of LTP by 77-LH-28-1. We tested this directly by recording NMDAR-mediated EPSCs in voltage clamp at a holding potential of −60 mV in the presence of NBQX (10 μM) and with reduced Mg<sup>2+</sup> concentration (0.5 mM). Application of 10 μM 77-LH-28-1 produced no change in the amplitude (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>A; 93% ± 6%, n = 6) or kinetics (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>B; decay time constant 76 ± 8 ms control versus 71 ± 7 ms 77-LH-28-1, n = 6) of the NMDAR-mediated EPSC, and, therefore, we conclude there is no direct effect of M<sub>1</sub> receptor activation on NMDARs.</p>
        <p>To verify this result, we also measured NMDAR activity by exogenous NMDA application, an approach that has previously shown an enhancement of NMDAR function by mAChR activation (<xref rid="bib3 bib26 bib37 bib38 bib39" ref-type="bibr">Aramakis et al., 1999; Harvey et al., 1993; Marino et al., 1998; Markram and Segal, 1990, 1992</xref>). We applied 1 mM NMDA by pressure application through a patch pipette placed in stratum radiatum close to the pyramidal cell-body layer while holding the CA1 pyramidal cell at −60 mV and with 1.3 mM Mg<sup>2+</sup> in the artificial cerebrospinal fluid (aCSF). This produced stable responses that lasted ∼10 s, and under these conditions, bath application of 10 μM carbachol produced an increase in the amplitude of the NMDA response (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>C; 150% ± 13%, n = 6, p &lt; 0.05) similar to that seen in previous reports (<xref rid="bib37" ref-type="bibr">Marino et al., 1998</xref>). However, when the membrane potential was set at +40 mV, the effect of carbachol application on NMDA responses was abolished (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>C; 91% ± 4%, n = 5, p &gt; 0.05). Taken together, these data indicate that NMDAR activation is enhanced by mAChR activation under conditions where Mg<sup>2+</sup> block of NMDARs is present (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>C; −60 mV) but not when Mg<sup>2+</sup> is absent (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>C; +40 mV) or significantly reduced (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figures 4</xref>A and 4B). This indicates that mAChR activation modulates synaptic NMDAR function via changes in membrane properties.</p>

        <title>M<sub>1</sub> Receptors Enhance the NMDAR-Mediated Component of EPSPs</title>
        <p>We next recorded cells in current clamp and examined the EPSP waveform in the presence of the GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor antagonist picrotoxin (50 μM) and the GABA<sub>B</sub> receptor antagonist CGP55845 (1 μM). Under these conditions, application of 77-LH-28-1 prolonged the duration of EPSPs (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref>A) and increased the decay time constant (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref>A; 80 ± 15 ms in control, 172 ± 32 ms in 77-LH-28-1, n = 7, p &lt; 0.05). The membrane time constant of the cell, measured by short subthreshold current injections, was also increased by application of 77-LH-28-1 (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref>B; 64 ± 8 ms in control, 91 ± 16 ms in 77-LH-28-1, n = 7, p &lt; 0.05), which could, at least partially, account for the prolongation of the EPSP.</p>
        <p>The depolarization and increase in input resistance caused by the activation of M<sub>1</sub> receptors could also enhance NMDAR activation during synaptic transmission and in particular during TBP. To assess the component of the EPSP mediated by NMDARs during TBP, we gave five presynaptic stimuli at 100 Hz and compared the resulting EPSP waveform in the presence and absence of 50 μM D-AP5 (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref>C). EPSP amplitude was set to ensure that EPSP summation was of a similar magnitude to that used in the experiments shown in <xref rid="fig2 fig3" ref-type="fig">Figures 2 and 3</xref>. Under these control conditions, no NMDAR-mediated component of the EPSP could be detected (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref>C; decay time constant normalized to control, 1.1 ± 0.3, n = 8, p &gt; 0.05). Application of 77-LH-28-1 depolarized the membrane potential by 2.8 ± 0.6 mV and caused a prolongation of the EPSPs similar to that seen in response to a single presynaptic stimulation (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref>D; decay time constant normalized to control, 1.8 ± 0.2, n = 6, p &lt; 0.05). Under these conditions, D-AP5 reversed the EPSP prolongation induced by 77-LH-28-1 (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref>D; decay time constant normalized to control, 0.9 ± 0.2, n = 6, p &lt; 0.05). When the membrane potential was repolarized to the membrane potential prior to 77-LH-28-1, D-AP5 still reduced the EPSP decay constant, indicating the EPSP prolongation and enhancement of the NMDAR-mediated EPSP was not due to membrane depolarization (decay constant normalized to control 1.1 ± 0.1 in 77-LH-28-1 and 0.77 ± 0.06 with addition of D-AP5, n = 6, p &lt; 0.05).</p>
        <p>The role of the M<sub>1</sub> receptor in mediating the effects of 77-LH-28-1 on the NMDAR-mediated component of the EPSP was confirmed with pirenzepine to block the 77-LH-28-1-induced prolongation of EPSPs (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref>E; decay time constant normalized to control, 1.0 ± 0.1, n = 6, p &gt; 0.05) and by using an orthosteric muscarinic receptor agonist oxotremorine-m (oxo-m, 10 μM) that produced a similar prolongation of the EPSP to 77-LH-28-1 and was also reversed by subsequent application of D-AP5 (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref>F; decay constant normalized to control 2.0 ± 0.2 in oxo-m and 1.0 ± 0.1 with addition of D-AP5, n = 6, p &lt; 0.05). These results were further confirmed with mice lacking the M<sub>1</sub> receptor. Application of 10 μM 77-LH-28-1 to slices taken from M<sub>1</sub>+/+ mice produced a prolongation of the EPSP similar to that found in slices from rats (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref>G; 1.7 ± 0.2, n = 5). In slices taken from M<sub>1</sub>−/− mice, the prolongation was absent (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref>G; 1.1 ± 0.03, n = 7). This indicates that the M<sub>1</sub> receptor agonist 77-LH-28-1 specifically activates M<sub>1</sub> receptors and augments the NMDAR-mediated component of the EPSP during the induction of LTP by TBP.</p>

        <title>M<sub>1</sub> Receptors Enhance NMDAR Activation by Inhibition of SK Channels</title>
        <p>Previous reports indicate that inhibition of SK channels prolongs the NMDAR-mediated component of EPSPs (<xref rid="bib19 bib42" ref-type="bibr">Faber, 2010; Ngo-Anh et al., 2005</xref>) and that mAChRs can modulate SK channel function (<xref rid="bib22 bib24" ref-type="bibr">Fiorillo and Williams, 2000; Gulledge and Stuart, 2005</xref>). Therefore, we tested whether the effect of 77-LH-28-1 on NMDAR activity was mediated by SK channels. Application of the selective SK channel blocker apamin (100 nM) caused a prolongation of summated EPSPs (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6</xref>A; decay time constant normalized to control, 1.3 ± 0.1, n = 13, p &lt; 0.01). Addition of 77-LH-28-1 did not produce any further prolongation of EPSPs (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6</xref>A; decay time constant normalized to control, 1.4 ± 0.1, n = 13, p &gt; 0.05 compared to apamin alone), indicating that apamin had occluded the action of 77-LH-28-1. Apamin application alone had no effect on either the membrane potential or input resistance of CA1 pyramidal cells (0 ± 0.2 mV and 28 ± 5 MΩ, p &gt; 0.05, n = 20) and the apamin-induced EPSP prolongation was also completely reversed by subsequent application of D-AP5 (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6</xref>B; decay time constant normalized to control, 1.39 ± 0.06 in apamin and 0.98 ± 0.06 with addition of D-AP5, n = 7, p &lt; 0.05). Interestingly, contrary to previous reports, apamin produced no reliable effect on summated EPSP amplitude (100% ± 6%, n = 20) (<xref rid="bib20 bib42" ref-type="bibr">Faber et al., 2005; Ngo-Anh et al., 2005</xref>). In addition, similar to the effects of 77-LH-28-1, apamin did not produce any change in EPSC amplitude or decay time constant (<xref rid="app2" ref-type="sec">Figure S2</xref>).</p>
        <p>M<sub>1</sub> receptors are also known to modulate other potassium channels, classically inhibiting KCNQ channels, which are believed to underlie the M current (<xref rid="bib40" ref-type="bibr">Marrion et al., 1989</xref>). When we tested the effects of the KCNQ channel blocker XE-991 (10 μM), the summated EPSPs were prolonged in a similar fashion to apamin (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6</xref>C; decay time constant normalized to control, 1.3 ± 0.1, n = 13, p &lt; 0.01). However, subsequent addition of 77-LH-28-1 produced a significant additional prolongation (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6</xref>C; decay time constant normalized to control, 1.6 ± 0.1, n = 13, p &lt; 0.05 compared to XE-991 alone), indicating that XE-991 does not occlude the action of 77-LH-28-1. XE-991 application alone produced a depolarization of the membrane potential and an increase in the input resistance of CA1 pyramidal cells (1.7 ± 0.4 mV and 47 ± 5 MΩ, p &lt; 0.05, n = 18) and the XE-991-induced EPSP prolongation was only partially reversed by subsequent application of D-AP5 (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6</xref>D; decay time constant normalized to control, 1.4 ± 0.1 in apamin and 1.2 ± 0.1 with addition of D-AP5, n = 7, p &lt; 0.05 for control versus XE-991 and XE-991 versus D-AP5).</p>
        <p>The effects of KCNQ channel and SK channel blockade on EPSP prolongation could be further separated into two distinct processes. The application of apamin produced an additional prolongation of the EPSP after the initial prolongation by XE-991 (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6</xref>E; decay time constant normalized to control, 1.40 ± 0.13 for XE-991 and 1.66 ± 0.20 for apamin combined with XE-991, n = 11, p &lt; 0.05 for control versus XE-991 and XE-991 versus apamin). These data indicate that membrane depolarization and increased input resistance seen in the presence of XE-991 are not sufficient to occlude the effects of M<sub>1</sub> receptor activation on NMDAR function.</p>
        <p>Muscarinic receptors have previously been shown to transiently enhance SK channel function by causing release of Ca<sup>2+</sup> from internal stores (<xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr">Gulledge and Stuart, 2005</xref>), but there is no evidence for muscarinic receptor activation inhibiting SK channel function. Therefore, we sought to confirm that M<sub>1</sub> receptors inhibit SK channels by measuring SK channel current directly. To do this, we recorded from CA1 pyramidal cells in voltage clamp using the perforated-patch technique. Depolarization of the cell from −50 mV to +10 mV for 100 ms and back to −50 mV revealed an afterhyperpolarization current (I<sub>AHP</sub>) that was largely insensitive to the KCNQ channel blocker XE-991 (10 μM, 90% ± 2% of peak control current, n = 6) but was robustly inhibited by the SK channel blocker apamin (100 nM, 10% ± 2% of peak control current, n = 6) (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6</xref>F). For all subsequent experiments, XE-991 (10 μM) was present throughout and the SK channel-mediated component of the I<sub>AHP</sub> was calculated by subtraction of the current remaining in apamin. The M<sub>1</sub> receptor agonist 77-LH-28-1 reduced the SK channel-mediated component of the I<sub>AHP</sub> to 57% ± 8% (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figures 6</xref>G and 6K; n = 6, p &lt; 0.05). When 77-LH-28-1 was removed, the inhibition partially reversed (74% ± 6%). We confirmed that activation of M<sub>1</sub> receptors inhibits the SK channel-mediated component of I<sub>AHP</sub> by reversing the sequence of drug application with the result that 77-LH-28-1 produced no additional inhibition of I<sub>AHP</sub> when applied after apamin (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figures 6</xref>H and 6K). The specificity of 77-LH-28-1 was confirmed by preincubation with pirenzipine (25 μM), which blocked the inhibition of I<sub>AHP</sub> by 77-LH-28-1 (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figures 6</xref>I and 6K; 99% ± 6% of control, n = 5, p &gt; 0.05) and by the use of oxotremorine-m (oxo-m, 10 μM), which produced a similar inhibition of I<sub>AHP</sub> to 77-LH-28-1 (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figures 6</xref>J and 6K; 39% ± 8% of control, n = 6, p &lt; 0.05).</p>

        <title>Inhibition of PKC Blocks the Inhibition of SK Channels by M<sub>1</sub> Receptors</title>
        <p>We next investigated the mechanism for the M<sub>1</sub> receptor-mediated inhibition of SK channels. M<sub>1</sub> receptors are thought to couple to Gq/11 subunits whose downstream signaling bifurcates into the production of IP<sub>3</sub> and DAG, leading to activation of PKC (<xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr">Delmas and Brown, 2005</xref>). Therefore, we tested whether PKC inhibitors could block the M<sub>1</sub> receptor-mediated prolongation of EPSPs and inhibition of I<sub>AHP</sub>. Bath application of the PKC inhibitor Go6976 (200 nM) significantly reduced the M<sub>1</sub> receptor-induced inhibition of I<sub>AHP</sub> (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7</xref>A; 87% ± 2% of control, n = 6, p &lt; 0.05 compared to 77-LH-28-1), indicating that activation of PKC by M<sub>1</sub> receptors is necessary for the inhibition of SK channels. Go6976 also significantly reduced the prolongation of EPSPs induced by application of 77-LH-28-1 (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7</xref>B; decay time constant normalized to control, 1.16 ± 0.08, n = 6, p &lt; 0.05 compared to 77-LH-28-1). Similarly, inclusion of the inhibitory PKC fragment PKC 19-36 in the patch pipette also significantly reduced the prolongation of EPSPs induced by application of 77-LH-28-1 compared to the prolongation induced in the presence of the inactive single mutation control peptide (Glu27)PKC 19-36 (<xref rid="bib27" ref-type="bibr">House and Kemp, 1987</xref>) (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7</xref>C; decay time constant normalized to control, 1.35 ± 0.05, n = 7 versus 1.17 ± 0.05, n = 14, p &lt; 0.05 for (Glu27)PKC 19-36 versus PKC 19-36, respectively).</p>

Therefore, we also tested whether the CK2 inhibitors 4,5,6,7-tetrabromobenzotriazole (TBB) or 2-(4,5,6,7-tetrabromo-2-(dimethylamino)-1H-benzo[d]imidazol-1-yl) acetic acid (TMCB) (<xref rid="bib44" ref-type="bibr">Pagano et al., 2008</xref>) could block the M<sub>1</sub> receptor-induced inhibition of I<sub>AHP</sub>. Incubation of slices in either 10 μM TBB or 10 μM TMCB for at least 1 hr had no effect on the M<sub>1</sub> receptor-induced inhibition of I<sub>AHP</sub> (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7</xref>D; TBB, 46% ± 7% of control, n = 6; TMCB, 71% ± 9% of control, p &gt; 0.05 compared to 77-LH-28-1 for both) suggesting that CK2 activity is not required for the inhibition of SK channels. CK2 also has direct effects on NMDAR function (<xref rid="bib34 bib46" ref-type="bibr">Lieberman and Mody, 1999; Sanz-Clemente et al., 2010</xref>). We found that incubation in 10 μM TMCB or TBB for periods of more than 1 hr greatly prolonged EPSPs (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7</xref>E; decay time constant, TMCB, 127 ± 34 ms, n = 9; TBB, 156 ± 29 ms, p &lt; 0.05 compared to control for both). This prolongation was also seen after 20 min of acute TMCB or TBB application (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7</xref>F; decay time constant normalized to control, TMCB, 1.21 ± 0.07, n = 7, TBB, 1.38 ± 0.12, n = 7, p &lt; 0.05 for both) but this prolongation was still seen in the presence of apamin (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7</xref>G; decay time constant normalized to control, apamin 1.24 ± 0.06, TBB 1.43 ± 0.09, n = 6, p &lt; 0.05), indicating that the effects of CK2 inhibition on EPSP duration are not mediated by SK channels.

      <p>Activation of mAChRs facilitates the induction of LTP in the hippocampus (<xref rid="bib9 bib43 bib50" ref-type="bibr">Boddeke et al., 1992; Ovsepian et al., 2004; Shinoe et al., 2005</xref>) and is critical for various forms of learning and memory (<xref rid="bib4 bib15 bib54" ref-type="bibr">Atri et al., 2004; De Rosa and Hasselmo, 2000; Warburton et al., 2003</xref>). The present study confirms a critical role for M<sub>1</sub> receptors in the facilitation of LTP and provides data demonstrating a role for SK channels mediating this facilitation.</p>
      <p>mAChR activation has been linked to modulation of potassium channels such as M-channels (KCNQ) (<xref rid="bib45 bib47" ref-type="bibr">Pfaffinger et al., 1985; Seeger and Alzheimer, 2001</xref>) and G protein-coupled inward-rectifier potassium channels (GIRK) (<xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">Brown et al., 1997</xref>). Our data support an additional inhibition of SK channels that is critical for the facilitation of LTP. SK channels have been shown to be ideally placed on the postsynaptic spine of Schaffer collateral synapses in the hippocampus where they can act to rapidly repolarize dendritic spines after AMPA receptor activation thereby limiting NMDAR activation and calcium influx through voltage-activated calcium channels (<xref rid="bib8 bib35 bib42" ref-type="bibr">Bloodgood and Sabatini, 2007; Lin et al., 2008; Ngo-Anh et al., 2005</xref>). Studies have also shown that blocking SK channels facilitates the induction of LTP (<xref rid="bib6 bib51" ref-type="bibr">Behnisch and Reymann, 1998; Stackman et al., 2002</xref>) and that genetic overexpression of SK2 channels inhibits LTP induction and hippocampal-dependent learning (<xref rid="bib25" ref-type="bibr">Hammond et al., 2006</xref>). However, until now it was unclear whether SK channel function could be modulated to regulate the induction of LTP. In the present study, we show that SK channels mediating a component of the I<sub>AHP</sub> are directly modulated by M<sub>1</sub> receptors (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6</xref>) and that blockade of SK channels with apamin occludes the action of M<sub>1</sub> receptor activation on NMDAR function (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6</xref>) and LTP induction (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Figure 8</xref>). Therefore, our data support the conclusion that SK channels can regulate the induction of LTP and provide evidence that SK channel function is controlled by activation of M<sub>1</sub> receptors.</p>
      <p>The detailed mechanism and the molecular interactions that connect M<sub>1</sub> receptor activation to SK channel inhibition are currently unknown. It has been shown that M<sub>1</sub> receptors and the G protein subunits Gq/11 are located at dendritic spines (<xref rid="bib52 bib56" ref-type="bibr">Tanaka et al., 2000; Yamasaki et al., 2010</xref>). Gq/11 subunits' downstream signaling bifurcates into the production of IP<sub>3</sub> and DAG, which has been shown to promote Ca<sup>2+</sup> release from intracellular stores, activate PKC, and locally deplete PIP<sub>2</sub> levels (<xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr">Delmas and Brown, 2005</xref>). Our data support the view that PKC activation is necessary for the inhibition of SK channels, but we cannot rule out an additional role for Ca<sup>2+</sup> release and/or PIP<sub>2</sub> depletion. Interestingly, SK channel inhibition by noradrenergic receptors in superior cervical ganglion cells acts through a different mechanism involving CK2 rather than PKC leading to a decrease in the calcium sensitivity of SK channels (<xref rid="bib36" ref-type="bibr">Maingret et al., 2008</xref>). However, there is little evidence that M<sub>1</sub> receptors couple to CK2. Our results suggest that muscarinic receptor inhibition of SK channels is not mediated by CK2. There is emerging evidence demonstrating that CK2 directly modulates NMDAR (<xref rid="bib34" ref-type="bibr">Lieberman and Mody, 1999</xref>) or regulates NMDAR subunit complement (<xref rid="bib46" ref-type="bibr">Sanz-Clemente et al., 2010</xref>), and our results showing a SK channel-independent modulation of EPSP duration (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7</xref>) potentially support such roles for CK2 at Schaffer collateral synapses in the hippocampus.</p>
      <p>Although KCNQ channels are thought to be preferentially targeted to the somatic membrane and are not present on dendritic spines, their blockade may still increase NMDAR activation as a result of cellular membrane depolarization and increase in input resistance (<xref rid="bib28 bib57" ref-type="bibr">Hu et al., 2007; Yue and Yaari, 2004</xref>). While this may indeed be the case, our data indicate that KCNQ channels do not mediate the facilitation of NMDAR function induced by M<sub>1</sub> receptor activation since blockade of KCNQ channels with XE-991 did not prevent the actions of M<sub>1</sub> receptor activation on NMDAR function (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6</xref>). The actions of M<sub>1</sub> receptors may therefore be separated into (1) an inhibition of SK channels that promotes NMDAR activity in dendritic spines and (2) an inhibition of KCNQ channels at the somatic membrane that depolarizes the membrane potential and increases input resistance. The other ion channels thought to be modulated by mAChRs, GIRK channels, are not thought to be modulated by M<sub>1</sub> receptors in CA1 pyramidal cells and are instead activated by M<sub>2</sub> receptors (<xref rid="bib47" ref-type="bibr">Seeger and Alzheimer, 2001</xref>). Our results also show that M<sub>1</sub> receptors inhibit somatic SK channels, which will presumably increase excitability by reducing the AHP (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6</xref>).</p>
      <p>Our data show that M<sub>1</sub> receptor activation prolongs the NMDAR-mediated component of the EPSP during LTP induction, and we suggest this is the mechanism for the facilitation of LTP (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref>). We also show that under optimized voltage clamp conditions, such as recording NMDA responses at +40 mV or small NMDAR-mediated EPSCs at −60 mV in reduced Mg<sup>2+</sup>, NMDAR activity is unchanged by M<sub>1</sub> receptor activation (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>). These data argue strongly against a direct action of M<sub>1</sub> receptor activation on NMDARs, such as has been suggested in previous reports (<xref rid="bib3 bib26 bib37 bib38 bib39" ref-type="bibr">Aramakis et al., 1999; Harvey et al., 1993; Marino et al., 1998; Markram and Segal, 1990, 1992</xref>). However, because of the voltage-dependent nature of the SK inhibition of NMDARs, when we record exogenous NMDA responses at −60 mV or EPSPs in current clamp, NMDAR activity is enhanced (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>).</p>
      <p>From a therapeutic point of view, this study suggests 77-LH-28-1 and similar compounds may be highly attractive as potential treatments for cognitive disorders (<xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr">Dean et al., 2003</xref>). Currently, the only effective treatments for patients with Alzheimer's disease are cholinesterase inhibitors and memantine. M<sub>1</sub> receptor agonists have been shown to ameliorate Aβ and tau pathology in animal models of Alzheimer's disease (<xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr">Caccamo et al., 2006</xref>) and to be beneficial for patients suffering from Alzheimer's disease and schizophrenia (<xref rid="bib16 bib30" ref-type="bibr">Dean et al., 2003; Koch et al., 2005</xref>) so the development of new allosteric M<sub>1</sub> receptor agonists could provide a major breakthrough in the treatment of these cognitive disorders.</p>
      <p>We have shown that LTP is facilitated when M<sub>1</sub> receptors are activated by either the specific allosteric M<sub>1</sub> receptor agonist 77-LH-28-1 (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>) or the endogenous ligand acetylcholine (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>). Since TBP does not induce LTP in control conditions, the facilitation by M<sub>1</sub> receptor activation is seen as a gating of LTP. Interestingly, the same is true when LTP is induced by patterns of activity believed to occur in vivo during exploration (<xref rid="bib29" ref-type="bibr">Isaac et al., 2009</xref>). Therefore, the regulation of SK channel function by M<sub>1</sub> receptor activation may be a critical step in the induction of hippocampal LTP in vivo.</p>

        <title>Slice Preparation</title>
        <p>Brain slices were prepared from P13-15 male Wistar rats or P60-70 male C57BL/6J mice lacking M<sub>1</sub> receptors (M<sub>1</sub>−/− kindly provided by Dr. J. Wess [<xref rid="bib41" ref-type="bibr">Miyakawa et al., 2001</xref>]) or age matched wild-type mice (M<sub>1</sub>+/+). Following a lethal dose of anesthetic (isoflurane inhalation), brains were removed and dissected in ice-cold aCSF (in mM, 119 NaCl, 2.5 KCl, 1 NaH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>.H<sub>2</sub>O, 26.2 NaHCO<sub>3</sub>, 10 glucose, 2.5 CaCl<sub>2</sub>, and 1.3 MgSO<sub>4</sub>) saturated with 95% O<sub>2</sub> and 5% CO<sub>2</sub>. Parasagittal hippocampal slices 300–400 μm thick were cut with a vibratome (DTK-1000, DSK, Japan, or VT1200, Leica, Germany) and slices were incubated in aCSF at 36°C for 30 min and then stored at room temperature until use. Before being transferred to the submerged recording chamber, the connections between CA3 and CA1 were cut. All experiments were performed in accordance with Home Office guidelines as directed by the Home Office Licensing Team at the University of Bristol.</p>

        <title>Whole-Cell Patch Clamp Recording</title>
        <p>Slices were placed in a submerged recording chamber perfused with aCSF (as above) at room temperature with the addition of 50 μM picrotoxin. CA1 pyramidal cells were visualized with infrared DIC optics on an Olympus BX-50 microscope. Patch electrodes with a resistance of 4–5 MΩ were pulled from borosillicate filamented glass capillaries (Harvard Apparatus) with a vertical puller (PC-10, Narashige, Japan). Pipettes were filled with intracellular solution containing (in mM) 120 KMeSO<sub>3</sub>, 10 HEPES, 0.2 EGTA, 4 Mg-ATP, 0.3 Na-GTP, 8 NaCl, and 10 KCl and set to pH 7.4, 280–285 mOsm.</p>
        <p>Recordings from CA1 pyramidal neurons were made with a multiclamp 700A amplifier (Molecular Devices, USA), filtered at 4 kHz and digitized at 10 kHz with a data acquisition board and Signal acquisition software (CED, Cambridge, UK). Cells were voltage clamped at −75 or −80 mV (after junction potential correction of −9.1 mV). Series resistance was monitored throughout the experiments and cells that showed &gt;20% change were discarded from subsequent analysis. Recordings were also rejected from analysis if the series resistance was greater than 30 MΩ. Bridge balance was employed for all current clamp recordings.</p>
        <p>Perforated-patch recordings were performed with patch pipettes of 4–5 MΩ resistance tip filled with the same intracellular solution to whole-cell recordings. Pipettes were then backfilled with the same intracellular solution supplemented with gramicidin (80 μg/ml). Gramicidin was prepared as a stock solution in DMSO (20 mg/ml). After formation of a gigaohm seal, the series resistance was monitored and recordings were commenced once stable. Series resistances averaged 36.1 ± 1.7 MΩ (n = 28), and recordings were not used if the series resistance changed by &gt;20% during data collection. Spontaneous rupture of the patched membrane was checked by continuous monitoring of series resistance. Tetrodotoxin (TTX; 1 μM) was continuously present in the aCSF. No leak subtraction was employed and the components of the I<sub>AHP</sub> mediated by KCNQ or SK channels were assessed pharmacologically.</p>
        <p>Extracellular field potential recordings were made from hippocampal slices bathed in aCSF containing picrotoxin with a patch pipette filled with aCSF. The initial slope of evoked synaptic responses was measured to calculate the amplitude of responses.</p>
        <p>Synaptic responses were evoked in control and test pathways with 100 μs square voltage steps applied at 0.1 Hz through two bipolar stimulating electrodes (FHC) located in stratum radiatum with the test pathway proximal and the control pathway distal to the pyramidal cell layer. Average baseline EPSC amplitudes in control and test pathways were similar for all LTP experiments. Postsynaptic action potentials were initiated through somatic current injections (2 nA, 2 ms) that reliably induced action potentials in all conditions.</p>
        <p>The resting membrane potential and input resistance of the cell were monitored in current clamp for a stable baseline period of 10–20 min before cholinergic agonists were washed into the recording chamber. The membrane potential and input resistance were monitored for a further 10–20 min. Input resistances were measured after the membrane voltage reached steady state.</p>
        <p>Focal application of 1 mM NMDA was performed through a glass electrode with a resistance of 3–4 MΩ placed in stratum radiatum close to the cell-body layer. A 1 mM NMDA solution in aCSF was pressure ejected (150 ms, 30–90 kPa) under the control of a spritzer (made in house). For the application of NMDA, 1 μM TTX was added to the aCSF and the intracellular solution contained (in mM) 117 CsMeSO<sub>3</sub>, 10 HEPES, 5 QX314-Cl, 0.2 EGTA, 4 Mg-ATP, 0.3 Na-GTP, and 8 NaCl and set to pH 7.4, 280–285 mOsm.</p>
        <p>CGP55845, D-AP5, LY341495, NBQX, picrotoxin, pirenzepine, oxotremorine-m, TBB, (Glu27)PKC 19-36, and Go6976 were purchased from Tocris. Apamin, TTX, TMCB, and XE-991 were purchased from Ascent Scientific. PKC 19-36 was purchased from Sigma. 77-LH-28-1 was a gift from GlaxoSmithKline. PKC 19-36 and (Glu27)PKC 19-36 were infused for at least 30 min before application of 77-LH-28-1. Slices were incubated in TBB and TMCB for at least 1 hr before application of 77-LH-28-1.</p>

        <title>Induction of Synaptic Plasticity</title>
        <p>EPSCs were recorded in voltage clamp from two independent pathways. TBP was applied after the neurons were switched into current clamp mode within 10 min of reaching the whole-cell configuration to prevent wash-out of plasticity. The TBP protocol consisted of a train of ten bursts where each burst consisted of five stimulations at 100 Hz with the frequency of bursts set at 5 Hz. Three trains were given separated by 10 s intervals. Where plasticity experiments were carried out in the presence of 77-LH-28-1, apamin, or XE-991, the drugs were washed into the bath before the whole-cell configuration was achieved and perfused throughout the experiment.</p>

        <title>Muscarinic EPSP</title>
        <p>Experiments involving stimulation of the muscarinic EPSP were carried out in horizontal slices as this maximized the density and connectivity of cholinergic fibers in the stratum oriens. The effects of 77-LH-28-1 on LTP induction were qualitatively similar in horizontal versus parasagittal slices. The muscarinic EPSP was elicited by a high-frequency burst of stimulation (4 stimuli at 100 Hz) delivered to a bipolar stimulating electrode placed in stratum oriens. The stratum oriens stimulation was delivered 2 s before the TBP protocol to ensure the peak of the muscarinic EPSP coincided with the start of the TBP protocol.</p>

        <title>Data Analysis</title>
        <p>Sweeps from the test and control pathways were separated and six consecutive traces were averaged together to produce a mean response every minute. EPSC amplitude measurements were taken from the mean traces and normalized to the mean baseline EPSC amplitude. Data are plotted as the mean ± standard error of the mean (SEM).</p>
        <p>Statistical tests were performed with paired or unpaired Student's t tests as appropriate. LTP was assessed by comparing the mean normalized EPSC amplitudes (or fEPSP slopes) in control and test pathways 25–30 min after induction.</p>

The arrow indicates the timing of the TBP protocol. Symbols as described in (A). Top: Example of voltage traces. The scale bars represent 25 mV, 20 ms. Middle: Example of EPSC current traces from a single experiment. The scale bars represent 50 pA, 40 ms.</p>
        <p>(C) 77-LH-28-1 (10 μM), apamin (100 nM), or a combination of 77-LH-28-1 and apamin all induce a similar amount of LTP.</p>
        <p>The data are plotted as the mean ± SEM.</p>
