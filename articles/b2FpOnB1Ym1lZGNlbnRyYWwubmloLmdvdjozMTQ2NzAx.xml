      <abstract>
        <p>Members of the Wnt family of secreted glyco-lipo-proteins affect intrathymic T-cell development and are abundantly secreted by thymic epithelial cells (TECs) that create the specific microenvironment for thymocytes to develop into mature T-cells. During ageing, Wnt expression declines allowing adipoid involution of the thymic epithelium leading to reduced naïve T-cell output. The protein kinase C (PKC) family of serine-threonine kinases is involved in numerous intracellular biochemical processes, including Wnt signal transduction. In the present study, PKCδ expression is shown to increase with age and to co-localise with Wnt receptors Frizzled (Fz)-4 and -6. It is also demonstrated that connective tissue growth factor (CTGF) is a Wnt-4 target gene and is potentially involved in a negative feed-back loop of Wnt signal regulation. Down-regulation of Wnt-4 expression and activation of multiple repressor pathways suppressing β-catenin dependent signalling in TECs contribute to the initiation of thymic senescence.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>During ageing of the immune system the gradual loss of naïve T-cells is associated with the rate of thymic adipose involution that correlates with significant destruction of the epithelial network. As impaired T-cell production leads to weakened immune responses, understanding the mechanism of thymic involution has high physiological and medical importance.</p>
      <p>In our recent studies of thymic involution Wnt-4 secretion was significantly reduced in TECs while LAP2α expression concomitantly increased triggering epithelial–mesenchymal transition (EMT) and then pre-adipocyte-differentiation (<xref rid="bib0060" ref-type="bibr">Kvell et al., 2010</xref>).</p>
      <p>As Wnt-4 is the primary regulator of FoxN1 expression and consequently TEC identity, understanding Wnt-4 signalling carries particularly high importance (<xref rid="bib0005" ref-type="bibr">Balciunaite et al., 2002</xref>). The difficulty of signalling studies, however, stems from the general complexity of Wnt pathways (<xref rid="bib0055" ref-type="bibr">Kuhl and Pandur, 2009</xref>). Wnt-4, for example, has been described as activator of both β-catenin dependent canonical (<xref rid="bib0075" ref-type="bibr">Lyons et al., 2004</xref>) and JNK/PKC dependent non-canonical (<xref rid="bib0010 bib0025" ref-type="bibr">Cai et al., 2002; Du et al., 1995</xref>) signalling pathways that interact at multiple levels. Apart from specific, there are also shared signalling elements in Wnt pathways including the main cell surface receptors Frizzleds (Fz) (<xref rid="bib0105" ref-type="bibr">Schulte and Bryja, 2007</xref>) as well as intracellular signalling molecules including G proteins (<xref rid="bib0080" ref-type="bibr">Malbon et al., 2001</xref>), Dishevelleds (Dvl) (<xref rid="bib0050 bib0105" ref-type="bibr">Kuhl et al., 2001; Schulte and Bryja, 2007</xref>) and PKCs α (<xref rid="bib0050" ref-type="bibr">Kuhl et al., 2001</xref>), ζ (<xref rid="bib0095" ref-type="bibr">Ossipova et al., 2003</xref>), and δ (<xref rid="bib0045" ref-type="bibr">Kinoshita et al., 2003</xref>). PKCδ appears particularly important as this serine-threonin kinase can phosphorylate and therefore activate Dvls (<xref rid="bib0045" ref-type="bibr">Kinoshita et al., 2003</xref>) to relay ligand induced signals towards down-stream elements of Wnt cascades.</p>
      <p>From the ten known mammalian Fz receptors, Fz-4 (<xref rid="bib0075" ref-type="bibr">Lyons et al., 2004</xref>) and Fz-6 (<xref rid="bib0075" ref-type="bibr">Lyons et al., 2004</xref>) have been confirmed to bind Wnt-4. Interestingly, while Fz-4 is an activator of the β-catenin dependent canonical pathway, signals from Fz-6 inhibit β-catenin dependent target gene transcription (<xref rid="bib0035" ref-type="bibr">Golan et al., 2004</xref>) indicating that regulation of Wnt-4 signalling might also begin at receptor level in the thymus.</p>
      <p>As thymic involution is a complex physiological process and appears to be initiated by suppression of Wnt signals, understanding of receptor associated regulatory mechanisms can lead to target molecule recognition in the quest for re-juvenate the ageing thymus. To investigate the hypothesis, TECs of young and ageing adult Balb/c mice as well as a thymic epithelial cell line, TEP1 were used in the studies. Our experiments demonstrate that expression of Wnt receptors increase with age and that Frizzleds co-localize with signalling molecules PKCδ and Dvl. Examination of Wnt-4 target gene expression provides evidence for the existence of additional negative regulatory loops suppressing β-catenin dependent signalling that aids repression of thymic epithelial maintenance and provides opportunities for EMT and consequent adipocyte type differentiation.</p>

        <title>Fz-4 and Fz-6 levels are affected by age</title>
        <p>Expression levels of Wnt-4 receptors, Fz-4 and Fz-6 were analysed in thymi of 1 month and 9 month old mice. The two age groups were selected specifically, as 1 month old mice are considered to be young adults where thymic involution has not yet begun. At the age of 9 months age associated morphological changes are not substantial yet, but characteristic age associated molecular and morphological changes can already be detected. This is not surprising as the detection of small lipid droplet-expressing cells in the perivascular space of <italic>FoxN1Cre mice</italic> has recently been reported as early as 3 months of age (<xref rid="bib0120" ref-type="bibr">Youm et al., 2009</xref>). Q-RT-PCR analysis of purified EpCAM1<sup>+</sup> TECs of 1 and 9 month old mouse thymi showed increased expression of Fz-4 and Fz-6 mRNA (<xref rid="fig0005" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>a and b) by 9 months of age. Immunohistochemistry using Fz-4 and Fz-6 specific antibodies confirmed elevated levels of both receptor proteins (<xref rid="fig0005" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>c–f) in ageing thymi. Additionally, differential expression pattern of Fz4 and Fz6 was also observed in the thymic medulla and cortex. While in the young thymus the medulla (EpCAM1<sup>++</sup>/Ly51<sup>−</sup>) was preferentially stained for Fz4 and Fz6, the cortex (EpCAM1<sup>+</sup>/Ly51<sup>+</sup>) only faintly stained for this receptor. In the 9 month old thymus the medulla is less pronounced and in contrast to the young tissue and the whole section including the cortex appears increasingly positive for both receptors.</p>

        <title>Active receptor signalling is indicated by PKCδ translocation</title>
        <p>Active receptor signalling is invariably associated with modified phosphorylation of receptor associated signalling molecules. As protein phosphorylation depends on the activity of kinases, being an acknowledged activator of Dvl, PKCδ activity was investigated in Wnt-4 signalling. To test the involvement of PKCδ in Wnt-4 signal transduction, increased Wnt-4 presence was achieved by treatment using the supernatant of Wnt-4-transgenic thymic epithelial (Tep1) cells (<xref rid="sec0130" ref-type="sec">Supplementary Fig. 1</xref>). Wild type Tep1 cells were exposed to SNs of control (Tep1-GFP) and Wnt-4 (Tep1-Wnt-4-GFP) cells for 1 h, then cytosolic and membrane fractions were isolated from cell lysates. Similarly to previous studies with Wnt-5a (<xref rid="bib0030" ref-type="bibr">Giorgione et al., 2003</xref>), Western blot analysis revealed that within one hour of Wnt-4 exposure PKCδ translocated into the membrane fraction (<xref rid="fig0010" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>a) where the cleavage products (<xref rid="bib0040" ref-type="bibr">Kanthasamy et al., 2006</xref>) characteristic of active PKCδ were detected. Densitometric analysis of total and cleaved PKCδ demonstrated PKCδ activation (2 fold increase) upon Wnt-4 exposure. Additionally, increased membrane localisation of PKCδ was also detected (39 fold increase) in the Wnt-4-overexpressing cell line (<xref rid="fig0010" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>a). As for Wnt-4 specific receptor expression, both Fz-4 and Fz-6 levels increased with age, therefore it was assumed that active receptor signalling might require more PKCδ during ageing. Indeed, apart from localisation of PKCδ to the membrane fraction (<xref rid="fig0010" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>a), up-regulation of PKCδ was also detected at both mRNA (<xref rid="fig0010" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>b) and protein level (<xref rid="fig0010" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>c and d) in the ageing thymi. Interestingly, a characteristic cortico-medullary PKCδ pattern has also emerged. In both young and ageing thymi PKCδ was preferentially expressed in the cortex (EpCAM1<sup>+</sup>/Ly51<sup>+</sup>) (<xref rid="fig0010" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>c and d).</p>

        <title>PKCδ in Wnt-4 signalling</title>
        <p>To specify the role of PKCδ in Wnt-4 signalling, it was necessary to identify a read-out gene that would reliably respond to Wnt-4 stimulus. Microarray (<xref rid="sec0130" ref-type="sec">Supplementary Table 1</xref>) and subsequent Q-RT-PCR analysis of Wnt-4 exposed Tep1 cells identified connective tissue growth factor (CTGF) as such a target gene for Wnt-4 (<xref rid="fig0005" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>s d). To investigate PKCδ involvement in Wnt-4 signalling, PKCδ activity was modified by overexpression of wild type PKCδ (<xref rid="sec0130" ref-type="sec">Supplementary Fig. 2a–c</xref>) or by PKCδ gene specific silencing using commercially available siRNA for PKCδ (Santa Cruz) (supplementary <xref rid="fig0010" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>d). Tep1 cells with increased or decreased PKCδ levels were exposed to control and Wnt-4 SNs for 1 hr, then CTGF expression was analysed. Surprisingly, although over-expression of PKCδ had no radical effect on Wnt-4 target gene transcription (<xref rid="fig0015" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>a), even moderate down-regulation of PKCδ was able to significantly increase CTGF expression (<xref rid="fig0015" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>b).</p>

        <title>Co-immunoprecipitation of PKCδ, with Dvl, Fz-4 and Fz-6</title>
        <p>To investigate whether PKCδ can associate with Fz-s, Fz-4 and Fz-6 co-immunoprecipitation patterns were analysed. Tep1 cells were treated with control and Wnt-4 SNs then proteins were immunoprecipitated using anti-Fz-4 and –Fz-6 antibodies, and probed for PKCδ and Dvl. Immunoprecipitation revealed increased association of PKCδ and its active cleavage products with both Fz-4 (1.2 fold, 2 fold and 1.4 fold, respectively) and Fz-6 (1.4 fold, 1.5 fold and strongly detectable over non-detectable, respectively) upon Wnt-4 treatment (<xref rid="fig0020" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref>a). To find out whether PKCδ co-localises with Fz-6 in primary thymic tissue, immunohistochemistry was performed. Experiments demonstrated age dependent increase of both Fz-6 and PKCδ as well as co-localisation of Fz-6 and PKCδ staining (<xref rid="fig0020" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref>c and d). While in the young thymus Fz-6 and PKCδ co-localisation is more pronounced in the thymic cortex (<xref rid="fig0020" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref>c), in the ageing thymus it is the medulla that exhibits stronger staining for both proteins (<xref rid="fig0020" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref>d).</p>

        <title>Increased expression of CTGF and Fz-8</title>
        <p>While increased expression and activity of the Fz-6 receptor, a suppressor of the canonical Wnt signalling pathway explains some aspects of uneven target gene transcription following manipulation of PKCδ activity, parallel changes like up-regulation of Fz-4 also occur during ageing that might add to the complexity of the signalling process. Increase in Fz-4 levels in ageing mice correlated with increased CTGF gene expression (<xref rid="fig0025" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref>a). If Fz-6 that also increases during senescence is truly a suppressor of β-catenin signalling then CTGF expression should have decreased or remained unchanged as Fz-4 transmitted signals would have been quenched by Fz-6 signalling. To test the above hypothesis, we have considered the following: CTGF has recently been reported to negatively regulate canonical Wnt signalling by blocking β-catenin stabilisation via GSK3β activation leading to phosphorylation and consequent degradation of β-catenin (<xref rid="bib0070" ref-type="bibr">Luo et al., 2004</xref>), indicating that CTGF might be part of a negative feed-back loop. As CTGF is a secreted protein, expression of Fz-8 (<xref rid="bib0090" ref-type="bibr">Mercurio et al., 2004</xref>) a recently reported receptor for CTGF was analysed in purified TECs of 1 and 9 months old thymi using Q-RT-PCR reactions. As parallel with CTGF, Fz-8 mRNA levels increased (<xref rid="fig0025" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref>b) in ageing mice, while FoxN1 (data not shown) similarly to 12 months old mice reported previously (<xref rid="bib0060" ref-type="bibr">Kvell et al., 2010</xref>), a direct target of β-catenin dependent Wnt-4 signals (<xref rid="bib0005" ref-type="bibr">Balciunaite et al., 2002</xref>) was undetectable indicating the existence of an additional negative feed-back loop.</p>

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>Naïve T cell production is highest in young individuals and declines as thymic involution progresses with age. This impaired T-cell production leads to weakened immune responses especially against novel viral infections and increased incidence of autoimmune diseases.</p>
      <p>In our previous work age-related down-regulation of Wnt-4 has been identified as a trigger for EMT and pre-adipocyte differentiation during thymic involution (<xref rid="bib0060" ref-type="bibr">Kvell et al., 2010</xref>). In the present work those Wnt receptor associated molecular mechanisms were investigated that can lead to structural and functional decline of the thymic epithelial network.</p>
      <p>As in the mouse down-regulation of Wnt-4 expression is known to have occurred by the age of 12 months (<xref rid="bib0060" ref-type="bibr">Kvell et al., 2010</xref>), an earlier time-point was probed. At the age of 9 months Wnt-4 and FoxN1 decline was measured to be moderate (data not shown) along with further characteristic morphological and molecular changes. Interestingly, both Wnt-4 receptors, Fz-4 and Fz-6 are up-regulated at this age coinciding with increased receptor signalling. Apart from increased activation of the inhibitory receptor Fz-6, the expression of CTGF a recently identified potential negative regulator of canonical Wnt signalling is also up-regulated. It has been described that Fz-6 receptor activation can lead to increased kinase (NLK and TAK) activity resulting in phosphorylation of TCF (<xref rid="bib0070" ref-type="bibr">Luo et al., 2004</xref>), an important component of the β-catenin-TCF transcription complex. Once phosphorylated, TCF can no longer bind to β-catenin therefore gene transcription initiated via the canonical Wnt signalling pathway (for example via Fz-4) is inhibited. In contrast to Fz-6 signalling, CTGF uses a different way to interfere with β-catenin dependent signal transduction. CTGF can interact with Fz-8 as well as LRP6, an important co-receptor of Wnt signalling (<xref rid="bib0090" ref-type="bibr">Mercurio et al., 2004</xref>) and can trigger activation of GSK3β (<xref rid="bib0015" ref-type="bibr">Crean et al., 2004</xref>) via PKC ζ. Activation of GSK3β leads to increased phosphorylation and accelerated degradation of β-catenin which results in suppression of canonical Wnt signals.</p>
      <p>Additional to increasing inhibitory pathways the loss of Wnt-4 levels can amalgamate age related decrease of FoxN1 and therefore loss of TEC identity that eventually leads to EMT and adipoid involution of the thymus. Our current hypothesis describing multiple mechanisms that lead to suppression of Wnt signalling is summarized in <xref rid="fig0030" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6</xref>.</p>
      <p>While it appears that active β-catenin signalling is absolutely essential for the maintenance of thymic epithelium, it is still not clear how imbalance in Wnt signalling affects de-regulation of thymic morphology. This is of note as recent experimental data where prolonged canonical Wnt signalling was enforced in TECs (<xref rid="bib0125" ref-type="bibr">Zuklys et al., 2009</xref>) describes similar changes in the thymic structure that is observed during both physiological and steroid induced ageing of the thymic epithelial network (<xref rid="bib0110" ref-type="bibr">Talaber et al., 2011</xref>). Importance of the balance in Wnt signalling is particularly well demonstrated in a Klotho deficient mouse model (<xref rid="bib0065" ref-type="bibr">Liu et al., 2007</xref>). The secreted protein Klotho can interact with various Wnt family members and suppresses biological activity of Wnts. Tissues and organs from Klotho-deficient animals show evidence of increased Wnt signalling resulting in accelerated cellular senescence both in vitro and in vivo. Based on the above model it has been postulated that depletion of the organ specific stem cell pool might be responsible for the accelerated ageing process in this setting.</p>
      <p>Nevertheless, our studies focusing on the role of PKCs in Wnt associated receptor signalling have highlighted additional complexities at the intracellular level. In previous studies PKCα and PKCδ have been implicated to play an active role in disassembly of the nucleus in early apoptosis by phosphorylating nuclear lamin proteins (<xref rid="bib0020" ref-type="bibr">Dreger et al., 1999</xref>). Lamina-associated polypeptide 2 (LAP2) has been described to require phosphorylation via PKCs to fulfil its physiological function and LAP2α is up-regulated during ageing within TECs. While theoretically PKCδ could have a role within the nucleus during senescence, our current experiments support PKCδ activity in the cell membrane as transducer of negative Wnt signals. These findings support our earlier conclusions, namely thymic involution is not directly associated with PKCδ–dependent mass apoptosis and replacement of TECs by invading adipocytes, but rather a slow EMT process that results in adipocyte type trans-differentiation of resident TECs (<xref rid="bib0060 bib0120" ref-type="bibr">Kvell et al., 2010; Youm et al., 2009</xref>).</p>
      <p>Upon Wnt-4 signalling PKCδ seems to associate both with Fz-4 and Fz-6, latter being an inhibitory receptor of the canonical Wnt pathway. If Wnt-4 triggers CTGF gene transcription as a canonical target via Fz-4, then suppression of Fz-6 signalling by down-regulating PKCδ levels can up-regulate CTGF expression (<xref rid="fig0015" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>a and b). Additionally, slight down-regulation of CTGF in the presence of PKCδ up-regulation also suits this hypothesis (<xref rid="fig0015" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>a). Yet, there are still questions to be addressed. For example as PKCδ can also associate with Fz-4 and have other functions in intracellular signalling therefore the mere up-regulation of PKCδ would not halt β-catenin dependent signal transduction.</p>
      <p>Further studies, however, are required and are on their way to identify the role of PKCδ in Fz-6 signalling and their combined task in thymic atrophy using in vitro cell line and in vivo transgenic animal studies.</p>

Data was normalised to β-actin. Statistically significant differences are marked by asterisks. (C–F) The expression level and staining pattern of Fz-4 and Fz-6 was also assayed by histology using anti-Fz-4-NL663 and anti-Fz-6-NL663 antibodies, respectively. Thymic morphology was displayed via staining with anti-EpCAM1-FITC and anti-Ly51-PE TEC markers. Size marker is shown in the corner of the figure. Characteristic stainings are shown from a minimum of five repeats.</p>
