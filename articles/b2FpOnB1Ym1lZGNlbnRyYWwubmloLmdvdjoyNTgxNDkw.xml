        <title>Summary</title>
        <p>Transcription of the lysozyme gene is rapidly induced by proinflammatory stimuli such as treatment with bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS). Here we show that this induction involves both the relief of repression mediated by the enhancer-blocking protein CTCF that binds to a negative regulatory element at −2.4 kb, and the activation of two flanking enhancer elements. The downstream enhancer has promoter activity, and LPS stimulation initiates the transient synthesis of a noncoding RNA (LINoCR) transcribed through the −2.4 kb element. Expression of LINoCR is correlated with IKKα recruitment, histone H3 phosphoacetylation in the transcribed region, the repositioning of a nucleosome over the CTCF binding site, and, eventually, CTCF eviction. Each of these events requires transcription elongation. Our data reveal a transcription-dependent mechanism of chromatin remodeling that switches a <italic>cis</italic>-regulatory region from a repressive to an active conformation.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>The inflammatory response requires the rapid activation of proinflammatory genes in cells of the innate immune system. Toll-like receptors play a critical role in responding to microbial components such as lipopolysaccharide (LPS) by activating common signal transduction pathways such as the mitogen-activated protein kinase family (<xref rid="bib17 bib40" ref-type="bibr">Guha and Mackman, 2001; Ronni et al., 2003</xref>). Specific transcription factors, such as NF-κB/Rel, AP-1 (Jun/Fos), and CAAT enhancer binding protein (C/EBP) families are the downstream targets of LPS-induced signaling (<xref rid="bib17 bib39 bib43" ref-type="bibr">Guha and Mackman, 2001; Plevy et al., 1997; Stein and Baldwin, 1993</xref>).</p>
      <p>The chicken lysozyme gene is a well-studied model to investigate the effects of proinflammatory stimuli on gene expression. It is upregulated during macrophage differentiation and reaches its highest expression level in LPS-stimulated macrophages. Transcription is controlled by three enhancers located 6.1, 3.9, and 2.7 kb upstream of the transcription start site, a complex promoter, and a negative regulatory element at −2.4 kb (<xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr">Bonifer et al., 1997</xref>). The −2.4 kb element was shown to have silencer activity via its ability to block the activity of the −2.7 kb enhancer and lysozyme promoter activity independently of its position and orientation (<xref rid="bib1 bib2" ref-type="bibr">Baniahmad et al., 1987, 1990</xref>). Transcription factor recruitment occurs in several steps, with the early acting transcription factors such as NF1 and Fli-1 binding first to the −6.1 and −3.9 kb enhancers, followed by the recruitment of CREB-binding protein (<xref rid="bib28 bib29" ref-type="bibr">Kontaraki et al., 2000; Lefevre et al., 2003</xref>). LPS stimulation leads to an additional recruitment of C/EBPβ and significant alterations in chromatin structure at the enhancers and promoter (<xref rid="bib28 bib30 bib29" ref-type="bibr">Kontaraki et al., 2000; Lefevre et al., 2005, 2003</xref>), such as a switch in the pattern of DNase I hypersensitive sites (DHSs). Prior to LPS induction, DHSs are present at the −2.4 kb element and at the −6.1 and −3.9 kb enhancers. Following stimulation, the DHS at the −2.4 kb element disappears, and two new DHSs appear at the −2.7 kb enhancer and at a hormone response element (HRE) at −1.9 kb. In addition, this region contains specifically positioned nucleosomes, which are remodeled after LPS stimulation (<xref rid="bib18 bib21 bib22 bib28" ref-type="bibr">Hecht et al., 1988; Huber et al., 1995, 1996; Kontaraki et al., 2000</xref>) (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>A). However, neither the exact kinetics of chromatin modification nor the nature of interdependence between these regulatory elements is known.</p>
      <p>CTCF is a highly conserved, ubiquitously expressed zinc finger protein that plays a critical role in transcriptional regulation in vertebrates with diverse functions including promoter repression or activation, enhancer-blocking activity, and chromatin insulation (<xref rid="bib4 bib27 bib36" ref-type="bibr">Bell et al., 1999; Klenova et al., 2002; Ohlsson et al., 2001</xref>). Recently, 13,804 CTCF-binding sites within the human genome were identified that are largely invariant across different cell types (<xref rid="bib26" ref-type="bibr">Kim et al., 2007</xref>), suggesting that CTCF is crucial for genome-wide transcription regulation. The −2.4 kb element was one of the first identified targets of the transcription factor CTCF. It is a composite regulatory element encompassing a thyroid hormone response element (TRE) located next to the CTCF-binding site (<xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr">Baniahmad et al., 1990</xref>), and it is also functional in insulator assays (<xref rid="bib32" ref-type="bibr">Lutz et al., 2003</xref>). Binding of the thyroid hormone receptor to the TRE abrogates the enhancer-blocking effect of CTCF in insulator assays, although it remains tethered to its binding site. The exact mechanism leading to the abrogation of CTCF-mediated insulator activity after thyroid hormone treatment is not understood, but specific phosphorylation and poly-ADP-ribosylation are two reported CTCF modifications important for changes in CTCF functions (<xref rid="bib13 bib47" ref-type="bibr">El-Kady and Klenova, 2005; Yu et al., 2004</xref>). In this respect, it is interesting to note that CTCF has recently been shown to recruit the cohesin complex to genomic sites and that this recruitment is crucial for the insulator activity of CTCF (<xref rid="bib37 bib45" ref-type="bibr">Parelho et al., 2008; Wendt et al., 2008</xref>).</p>
      <p>In this report, we studied the mechanism of lysozyme gene activation by proinflammatory stimuli. We show that CTCF recruits cohesin to the lysozyme element and that LPS stimulation results in the eviction of the CTCF/cohesin complex. This leads to the abrogation of CTCF-mediated repression, and we demonstrate that this eviction relies on transcription-dependent nucleosome remodeling.</p>

        <title>Induction of Lysozyme mRNA Expression Is Preceded by Recruitment of Transcription Factors and RNA Polymerase II to Upstream Regulatory Elements</title>
        <p>Our previous work demonstrated that LPS treatment causes extensive chromatin modifications within the 5′ region of the lysozyme locus (<xref rid="bib21 bib22 bib30 bib29" ref-type="bibr">Huber et al., 1995, 1996; Lefevre et al., 2005, 2003</xref>). To investigate the molecular mechanism of this process, we studied the order of events occurring within chromatin leading to the upregulation of the gene after LPS stimulation. As a model, we employed the HD11 chicken monocyte cell line, which upon LPS treatment undergoes terminal differentiation and growth arrest. The genomic and chromatin organization of the lysozyme locus in macrophages is summarized in <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>A (<xref rid="bib11 bib21" ref-type="bibr">Chong et al., 2002b; Huber et al., 1995</xref>). We first examined the timing of upregulation of lysozyme mRNA levels following LPS stimulation (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>B). After stimulation, lysozyme mRNA levels remained unchanged for at least 30 min but then doubled after a further 15 min and after 2 hr of LPS treatment reached a plateau corresponding to five to ten times the level present in the untreated control.</p>
        <p>We next measured transcription factor and RNA polymerase II (RNA Pol II) recruitment within the 5′-regulatory region during a time course of induction by chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) in HD11 cells. LPS stimulation induces a redistribution of C/EBPβ protein from the cytoplasm to the nucleus (<xref rid="bib25" ref-type="bibr">Katz et al., 1993</xref>). We therefore expected a rapid increase in C/EBPβ binding to lysozyme <italic>cis</italic>-regulatory elements. This was found at the promoter, where C/EBPβ occupancy increased after 20 min of induction (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>A). However, C/EBPβ occupancy changed only weakly at the −2.7 kb enhancer and only after 2 hr (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>A). In contrast, C/EBPβ progressively accumulated at the −1.9 kb HRE with similar kinetics as observed at the promoter (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>A). We next focused on AP-1 as another LPS inducible transcription factor known to target the lysozyme gene (<xref rid="bib16 bib38" ref-type="bibr">Grewal et al., 1992; Phi van, 1996</xref>). Using an antibody that recognizes all Fos family members, we detected AP-1 binding at the −3.9 and −2.7 kb enhancers in HD11 cells (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>B), which increased after LPS stimulation. In addition, as observed for C/EBPβ, Fos/AP-1 was undetectable at the HRE prior to LPS treatment but was bound 20 min after stimulation, reaching a plateau after 45 min (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>B). Furthermore, Fos recruitment at the −2.7 kb enhancer was faster than C/EBPβ. As expected (<xref rid="bib29" ref-type="bibr">Lefevre et al., 2003</xref>), the Ets family member Fli-1 only bound to the −3.9 kb element, and this binding was not LPS inducible (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>C).</p>
        <p>The level of RNA Pol II recruitment to the lysozyme gene paralleled the accumulation of C/EBPβ and Fos/AP-1 at the −1.9 kb element and the promoter. These data are consistent with mainly transcriptional activation of lysozyme gene expression after LPS stimulation. After 20–30 min following LPS treatment, RNA Pol II was recruited to <italic>cis</italic>-regulatory elements located within 3 kb upstream of the transcription start (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>D). These data indicate that (1) transcription factor binding and RNA Pol II recruitment are concomitant and (2) changes observed after brief LPS stimulation are limited to the first 3 kb of the 5′-regulatory region.</p>

        <title>LPS Induces CTCF Eviction and Nucleosome Remodeling within the HRE/−2.4/−2.7 kb Region</title>
        <p>We next focused on chromatin changes within the 3 kb upstream region during a time course of LPS induction. To this end, we performed micrococcal nuclease (MNase) mapping of nucleosome positions as well as DHS analysis (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>A). At the −1.9 kb HRE, we noted the rapid induction of a strong DHS with a parallel increase in hypersensitivity at the −2.7 kb enhancer. This DHS existed as two closely linked regions centered at −1.9 and −2.1 kb that were hypersensitive to both DNase I and MNase. A preferential MNase digestion site detected in the genomic DNA control at −2113 bp and the MNase site downstream were both protected by nucleosomes in nonstimulated cells and became fully accessible after 30 min LPS treatment.</p>
        <p>In the −2.4/−2.7 kb region, we noted that in untreated HD11 cells the MNase hypersensitive sites at −2366 and −2430 bp mark the boundary of the CTCF complex occupying a ∼80 bp nucleosomal linker region. The MNase sites at −2553 and −2693 bp flank a DHS indicative of a protein complex interacting with the −2.7 kb enhancer (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>A). These results are consistent with the presence of a positioned nucleosome between −2430 and −2597 bp. After LPS induction, several chromatin features in this region were altered. Of the two strong MNase hypersensitive regions flanking the CTCF binding site, only one remained, albeit weakly, at −2366 bp and an additional region at −2553 bp downstream of the C/EBP binding site at the −2.7 kb enhancer was preferentially cleaved. These changes indicated the displacement of the positioned nucleosome located at −2430 to −2597 bp to position between −2366 to −2553 bp, now occupying the CTCF binding site. This was confirmed by densitometric analysis of the MNase data after correction for the MNase sensitivity of genomic DNA control digests (<xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">Bert et al., 2007</xref>) (see <xref rid="app2" ref-type="sec">Figure S1</xref> available online). This result is important because CTCF cannot bind to nucleosomal DNA (<xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr">Kanduri et al., 2002</xref>), and this movement also frees up the C/EBP binding site located at −2562 bp. Interestingly, in contrast to the −1.9 kb region, nucleosome reorganization in the −2.4/−2.7 kb region required 1–4 hr of LPS stimulation.</p>
        <p>To directly test the consequences of this nucleosome movement for CTCF binding, we measured CTCF binding by ChIP assays and real-time PCR after exposure to LPS. As expected, CTCF bound to the −2.4 kb element in untreated HD11 cells and also in the erythroblast cell line HD37. However, after LPS treatment, CTCF binding disappeared (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>B). No change in binding was seen at another CTCF target, the chicken β-globin <italic>cis</italic>-regulatory element HS4 (<xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">Bell et al., 1999</xref>), confirming that eviction is lysozyme gene specific (<xref rid="app2" ref-type="sec">Figure S2</xref>). Taken together, our data indicate that LPS-induced transcription factor association leads to significant alterations in chromatin architecture that are incompatible with CTCF binding.</p>
        <p>We next investigated the consequences of CTCF binding and eviction on lysozyme transcription. We knocked down CTCF using a cocktail of three RNAi molecules, stimulated HD11 cells with LPS 24 hr later, and measured lysozyme mRNA upregulation (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>C). Knockdown of CTCF mRNA and protein (≈60%) was confirmed by real-time PCR and western blotting (<xref rid="app2" ref-type="sec">Figures S3</xref>A and S3B). No difference in lysozyme mRNA levels was measured after 24 hr of knockdown, indicating that CTCF depletion was not sufficient to upregulate lysozyme mRNA expression in the absence of LPS treatment. However, we observed an earlier onset of induction (30 min), indicating a repressive role of CTCF prior to LPS treatment. Taken together, this shows that the upregulation of lysozyme expression is mediated by both CTCF eviction and the LPS-induced recruitment of transcription factors.</p>

        <title>The −1.9 kb DHS Is a Dual Promoter/Enhancer Element in Macrophages, and LPS Stimulation Transiently Increases Transcription from this Element</title>
        <p>We previously demonstrated that an increase in histone H3 lysine 4 methylation (H3meK4) correlates with the transcriptional activity of the lysozyme gene (<xref rid="bib30" ref-type="bibr">Lefevre et al., 2005</xref>). Here we show that within the −1.9 and −2.7 kb regions this increase correlates with RNA Pol II recruitment (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>D). Because many transcripts from eukaryotic genomes correspond to noncoding RNAs (<xref rid="bib34" ref-type="bibr">Mattick, 2005</xref>), we searched for such transcripts in the lysozyme <italic>cis</italic>-regulatory region by using strand-specific RT-PCR employing biotinylated primers (data not shown). We detected an antisense transcript overlapping the −2.4/−2.7 kb region, but not the −1.9 kb region (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figures 4</xref>A and 4B). We named this transcript LINoCR (LPS Inducible NonCoding RNA). Using 5′-RACE and RNase protection assays, we mapped the transcription start site of LINoCR to −2120 bp (<xref rid="app2" ref-type="sec">Figures S4</xref>A and S4B).</p>
        <p>LINoCR was detectable after 30 min of LPS stimulation, peaked between 45 min and 1 hr, decreased by 65% after 2 hr, and became undetectable after 8 hr LPS stimulation (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>B). Taking into account that transcription may not be completely shut down, this indicated a half-life of this transcript of 45 min or less. The localization of the transcription start site and the de novo induction of a DHS suggested that the −1.9 kb element was the promoter. We therefore cloned the −1.9 kb element in both orientations upstream of a luciferase gene and assayed reporter gene activity after transient transfection into HD11 cells with and without LPS treatment (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>C). A reporter construct carrying the lysozyme mRNA promoter served as positive control. The −1.9 kb element exhibited promoter activity in the antisense orientation, but only after LPS treatment. The −1.9 kb element has been shown to be a steroid hormone-responsive enhancer element in nonmyeloid cells (<xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr">Hecht et al., 1988</xref>). We placed it upstream or downstream of the lysozyme promoter, and the position-independent activity confirmed that this element is an enhancer in macrophages (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>D and data not shown).</p>
        <p>In summary, we conclude that the −1.9 kb element has dual promoter/enhancer function and that LINoCR, transcribed from this element, reads through the −2.4 kb element with a peak of expression correlating with the upregulation of lysozyme gene expression after LPS treatment.</p>

        <title>Histone H3 S10 Phosphorylation Spatially and Temporally Correlates with LINoCR Transcription</title>
        <p>H3 S10 phosphorylation has been previously observed at inducible genes in response to mitogenic or stress stimuli (<xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr">Clayton et al., 2000</xref>) and is associated with HP1 dissociation from heterochromatin during DNA replication (<xref rid="bib19 bib33" ref-type="bibr">Hirota et al., 2005; Mateescu et al., 2004</xref>). We therefore tested whether this histone modification increased upon LPS induction and whether it correlated with CTCF eviction. To this end, we analyzed changes in both histone H3 K9 acetylation (H3 AcK9) and H3 S10 phosphorylation during LPS stimulation using ChIP assays with antibodies recognizing just H3 AcK9 or both marks together on the same histone tail (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref>). H3 AcK9 increased at the −6.1, −3.9, −2.7, and −2.4 kb elements from 30 min following LPS treatment and also slightly at the promoter and the −1.9 kb element (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref>A). However, the pattern and timing of dual H3 S10 phosphorylation/K9 acetylation after induction were different. While H3 AcK9 increased throughout the 5′-regulatory region, H3 phosphoacetylation was restricted to the −2.4/−2.7 kb region and appeared only transiently between 30 min and 1 hr (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref>B). These data suggest a precise correlation between LINoCR expression and the appearance of the histone H3 S10 phosphorylation mark.</p>
        <p>Histone H3 phosphorylation by MSK1/2 has previously been associated with the activation of inducible genes in response to mitogenic or stress stimulation (<xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr">Clayton et al., 2000</xref>), raising the possibility that MSK1/2 was the responsible kinase for histone H3 S10 phosphorylation at the lysozyme locus. However, the MSK1/2 inhibitor H89 did not prevent histone phosphorylation at the −2.4 kb element (data not shown). We found instead that IKKα was transiently recruited to the −2.4 kb element (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref>C), as shown for cytokine-induced genes (<xref rid="bib46" ref-type="bibr">Yamamoto et al., 2003</xref>).</p>

        <title>CTCF Eviction from the −2.4 kb Element Is Transcription Dependent</title>
        <p>The experiments described above demonstrated that (1) after LPS induction RNA Pol II was simultaneously recruited to the −1.9 kb region and to the promoter, and (2) the presence of CTCF at the −2.4 kb element delayed LPS-induced lysozyme gene activation. It was also possible that CTCF regulated LINoCR expression. Therefore we knocked down CTCF expression in HD11 cells with and without 1 hr LPS treatment when LINoCR expression was maximal. CTCF knockdown had no effect on LINoCR expression (<xref rid="app2" ref-type="sec">Figures S3</xref>C and S3D), indicating that LINoCR transcription was regulated by the LPS-induced binding of transcription factors to the −1.9 kb element.</p>
        <p>The experiments described so far raised the possibility of a direct link between promoter activity at the −1.9 kb element and transcription-associated alterations of histone modification, nucleosome repositioning, and CTCF eviction. The small size of the −2.7/−2.4/−1.9 kb region and the importance of precisely coordinated alterations of chromatin architecture excluded testing this hypothesis by inserting a transcription termination element that in itself spans several hundred base pairs. We therefore blocked transcriptional elongation by using the specific inhibitor 5,6-dichloro-1-β-D-ribofuranosylbenzimidazole (DRB). It has previously been shown that short-term DRB treatment has no influence on RNA-polymerase association and transcription factor binding (<xref rid="bib35" ref-type="bibr">Mitchell and Fraser, 2008</xref>). The onset of RNA Pol II and transcription factor binding at the −1.9 kb element occurred within 20 min after LPS stimulation (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>). Therefore, HD11 cells were stimulated with LPS for 15 min and then treated with DRB. Under these conditions, transcriptional activation of immediate early genes like cJun and cFos as factors necessary for mediating LPS induction was not affected (<xref rid="app2" ref-type="sec">Figure S5</xref>). In agreement with this idea, nucleosome remodeling and the formation of a DHS at the −1.9 kb element were unaffected (<xref rid="app2" ref-type="sec">Figure S8</xref>). However, DRB treatment completely blocked LINoCR expression, IKKα recruitment, and histone H3 S10/K9 phosphoacetylation at the −2.4 kb element (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figures 6</xref>A–6C).</p>
        <p>The initial ChIP assays demonstrating CTCF eviction in chicken cells (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>B) were performed using an antibody that is no longer available, so we explored an alternative model system. The complete chicken lysozyme locus is expressed in a position-independent fashion in transgenic mice and adopts the identical chromatin structure as in chicken cells (<xref rid="bib8 bib20 bib44" ref-type="bibr">Bonifer et al., 1990; Huber et al., 1994; Tagoh et al., 2004</xref>). We therefore repeated our experiments using primary macrophages from mice carrying a single copy of the chicken lysozyme locus (<xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">Chong et al., 2002a</xref>). This also enabled us to look for the presence of Rad21, a protein of the cohesin complex (<xref rid="bib37 bib45" ref-type="bibr">Parelho et al., 2008; Wendt et al., 2008</xref>). In primary mouse macrophages, chicken lysozyme mRNA and LINoCR expression followed the same kinetics as in HD11 cells (<xref rid="app2" ref-type="sec">Figure S6</xref>). Both CTCF and Rad21 were detected by real-time PCR at the −2.4 kb element and were both evicted after LPS stimulation (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6</xref>C), suggesting that both proteins participate in regulating its activity. However, this did not occur when LPS stimulation was followed by DRB treatment 15 min later (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6</xref>C). In contrast, the mouse β-globin <italic>cis</italic>-regulatory element HS1, which is known to bind CTCF (<xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr">Farrell et al., 2002</xref>), also bound Rad21 but did not show any change in the binding of either protein after LPS treatment, again confirming that CTCF and Rad21 eviction were lysozyme specific (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6</xref>D). These data suggest that transcription is necessary for the eviction of the CTCF/cohesin complex from its binding site.</p>

        <title>The LPS-Induced Nucleosome Shift between the −2.4 and −2.7 kb Elements Is Transcription Dependent</title>
        <p>We next employed a real-time quantitative PCR assay to examine nucleosome positioning in the presence or absence of transcription. As template, we used genomic DNA purified from the mononucleosome fraction of chromatin from induced and noninduced HD11 cells extensively digested with MNase. Overlapping primers (P1–P14) were designed spanning the −1.9/−2.7 kb region, with each amplicon being 60–65 bp long (<xref rid="app2" ref-type="sec">Figure S7</xref>). This approach allowed us to distinguish between nucleosomal length-protected regions and shorter DNA regions protected by transcription factor complexes associated with nuclease hypersensitive sites. The results were in agreement with our earlier prediction of the predominant nucleosome positions (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>). In unstimulated HD11, maximum DNA amplification was observed with P5 and P9–P11 primers corresponding to the nucleosomal regions between −2540 and −2430 bp, and −2267 and −2200 bp, respectively. In contrast, the CTCF-containing linker region between −2366 and −2430 bp presented a low enrichment with P6, P7, and P8 primers (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7</xref>A). Similarly, upstream of the −2597 bp linker MNase site, low DNA enrichment correlated with the presence of the DHS encompassing the −2.7 kb enhancer (P1–P4). Here the amount of nucleosomal material detected further decreased after stimulation, correlating with the full activation of the −2.7 kb enhancer element.</p>
        <p>Inducible nucleosome reorganization was also detected in the region flanking the −1.9 kb HRE (P12–P14). While nucleosomes occupied most of the −2310 to −2050 bp region in unstimulated cells, the region from −2100 to −2050 bp was predominantly nucleosome-free in stimulated cells after 1 hr (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7</xref>A). This remodeled region corresponds to one of the two nuclease hypersensitive regions seen in <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>A that define the inducible −1.9 kb DHS and most likely the boundary of the LINoCR promoter. The CTCF-containing linker region (P6–P8) became progressively more protected in stimulated cells and was predominantly nucleosomal after 4 hr of LPS treatment. We observed a parallel decrease in signal at the −2550 bp position (P5), confirming that LPS induces movement of a nucleosome from a position occupying the C/EBP site to a position occupying the CTCF site.</p>
        <p>After DRB treatment, no alteration of nucleosome positioning in noninduced HD11 cells was observed (<xref rid="app2" ref-type="sec">Figures S8</xref>A and S8B). Significantly, DRB treatment 15 min after LPS stimulation blocked relocation of the nucleosome from the C/EBP site to the CTCF site (seen with P5 and P6, <xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7</xref>B). Transcription dependence of nucleosome remodeling at the −2.4 kb element was specific for this region, since DRB treatment had no effect on any other LPS-induced chromatin alterations downstream and upstream these two transcription factor-binding sites. Therefore, DNA amplification with P7 and P8 primers designed in the CTCF-containing linker region significantly increased after LPS and DRB treatment compared to untreated cells, suggesting that full occupancy at −2.7 and −1.9 kb elements restricted the position of the nucleosomes in the vicinity of the −2.4 kb element. These results were independently confirmed by two indirect end-labeling experiments (<xref rid="app2" ref-type="sec">Figure S8</xref>). Taken together, these experiments demonstrate a close link between transcription, nucleosome remodeling at the −2.4 kb element, and CTCF eviction.</p>

      <sec id="sec3.1">
        <title>LPS Induction Activates a <italic>cis</italic>-Regulatory Element with Dual Enhancer/Promoter Function</title>
        <p>The −1.9 kb promoter/enhancer is an interesting example of an element exerting differential inducible functions in two different tissues (oviduct and macrophages). It was previously shown to be important for the steroid-inducible expression of lysozyme in nonmyeloid cells (<xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr">Hecht et al., 1988</xref>). Here we provide insights into the role of this element in myeloid cells and into the molecular mechanism of its activation. The −1.9 kb element is the only lysozyme 5′ <italic>cis</italic>-regulatory element that is not occupied by transcription factors prior to induction, underlining the importance of the chromatin environment for these proteins to access their DNA-binding sites. It binds AP-1 and C/EBPβ 20 min after LPS induction, and activation is associated with extensive remodeling of the underlying chromatin. Two inducible MNase and DHSs located at −2.1 and −1.9 kb flank the predicted start site at −2.0 kb and most likely represent regions in which nucleosomes have been displaced.</p>
        <p>As a promoter, the −1.9 kb element drives the transient expression of a noncoding transcript (LINoCR), which reads through the −2.4 kb element. After LPS induction, transcription factor and RNA Pol II are rapidly and simultaneously recruited to both promoters, and LINoCR expression is detected prior to increased lysozyme mRNA expression. Our CTCF knockdown experiments showing that CTCF/cohesin interferes only with lysozyme mRNA expression explain this timing discrepancy and suggest that LINoCR transcription is a prerequisite for the abrogation of the repressive activity of CTCF. They also demonstrate that this repressive activity is context dependent.</p>

      <sec id="sec3.2">
        <title>LPS Stimulation Leads to CTCF Eviction from the −2.4 kb Element</title>
        <p>An important result from this study is our finding that CTCF is evicted from its binding site after LPS stimulation. Previous publications have established that CTCF enhancer-blocking functions could be regulated, but without change in CTCF occupancy (<xref rid="bib13 bib32" ref-type="bibr">El-Kady and Klenova, 2005; Lutz et al., 2003</xref>). We also established that Rad21, a protein of the cohesin complex, colocalizes with CTCF at the lysozyme locus as observed at other gene loci (<xref rid="bib37 bib45" ref-type="bibr">Parelho et al., 2008; Wendt et al., 2008</xref>), providing an interesting example of an enhancer-blocking element bisecting a regulatory region and repressing gene expression. Both proteins are evicted from the −2.4 kb element. In yeast, transcription elongation into cohesin-associated sites results in local dissociation of cohesin/chromosome interaction (<xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">Bausch et al., 2007</xref>). This observation suggests a possible role of LINoCR transcription in the eviction of the CTCF/cohesin complex, and we indeed observed that CTCF and Rad21 eviction from the −2.4 kb element was transcription elongation dependent. LINoCR is highly unstable, and we were unable to knock it down by siRNA, indicating that targeted molecules may be already on their way for degradation. This makes it difficult to completely exclude an effect of LINoCR on CTCF/cohesin eviction in <italic>trans</italic> but supports the idea that transcription itself has a regulatory function. This observation is also consistent with the reported short half-life of other ncRNAs impacting on gene regulation in <italic>cis</italic>, such as the imprinting-regulating antisense transcript Air (<xref rid="bib42" ref-type="bibr">Seidl et al., 2006</xref>). In addition, we did not observe a delay between LINoCR transcription and histone H3 acetylation/phosphorylation. These data argue in favor of a fast deactivation of the CTCF-associated repressive complex rather than a <italic>trans</italic>-acting effect.</p>

      <sec id="sec3.3">
        <title>CTCF Eviction Is Associated with Transcription-Dependent Repositioning of a Nucleosome over the CTCF-Binding Site</title>
        <p>Differential CTCF binding has been shown to involve differential methylation at imprinted genes (see, for example, <xref rid="bib41" ref-type="bibr">Schoenherr et al., 2003</xref>). As the CTCF site at the −2.4 kb element does not contain a CpG, our results argue for an important role of chromatin structure in the eviction of CTCF. Histone H3 phosphorylation has been associated with the eviction of HP1 from heterochromatin during DNA replication (<xref rid="bib19 bib33" ref-type="bibr">Hirota et al., 2005; Mateescu et al., 2004</xref>). However, it is not known whether CTCF, like HP1, is capable of interacting with histone tails. Therefore, elongation-dependent recruitment of the IKKα kinase and phosphorylation at the −2.4 kb element may be associated with the destabilization of a CTCF-associated silencing complex (<xref rid="bib31" ref-type="bibr">Lutz et al., 2000</xref>). It has indeed been shown that CTCF loses its repressive properties after phosphorylation (<xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr">El-Kady and Klenova, 2005</xref>). However, our analysis of the nucleosome positioning before and after LPS treatment indicates an additional mechanism ensuring permanent CTCF eviction that employs nucleosome repositioning to prevent the reassociation of CTCF with its binding site after LPS stimulation.</p>
        <p>Remarkably, DRB treatment only affected CTCF/cohesin eviction and LPS-induced repositioning of the nucleosome over the CTCF-binding site. These observations rule out an unspecific effect of DRB on transcription factor binding, chromatin structure, and LPS signaling. CTCF cannot bind once its target site is covered by a nucleosome (<xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr">Kanduri et al., 2002</xref>). Our data are consistent with the idea that, in the context of the −2.4 kb element, the CTCF/cohesin complex prevents the full activation of the −2.7 kb enhancer and that the passage of the RNA Pol II complex together with histone H3 S10 phosphorylation and a concomitant destabilization of nucleosomes induces a resetting of the chromatin structure over the CTCF-binding site and allows additional C/EBPβ proteins to be recruited to the −2.7 kb enhancer.</p>
        <p>In summary, we have identified a mechanism that employs transcription-dependent alterations in chromatin architecture for the inducible regulation of the lysozyme gene (<xref rid="app2" ref-type="sec">Figure S9</xref>). It has been suggested that as much as 98% of the transcriptional input in human genome does not encode for protein (<xref rid="bib34" ref-type="bibr">Mattick, 2005</xref>). Therefore, the ability of intergenic transcription to alter the regulatory properties of <italic>cis</italic>-elements as exemplified by the lysozyme gene may provide a general mechanism of gene regulation.</p>

        <p>Chromatin from LPS-treated HD11 cells was precipitated with antibodies for (A) C/EBPβ, (B) Fos, (C) Fli-1, or (D) RNA Pol II. Increasing incubation times in minutes are illustrated by increasing gray intensity from uninduced cells (no LPS) in white to 2 hr LPS induction in black (120 min). Data are analyzed by real-time PCR with primers named according to their distance from the transcription start site. The amount of PCR product for each primer is expressed relative to a genomic DNA serial dilution. Data are expressed using the following formula (specific IP/IgG)<sub>x</sub>/(specific IP/IgG)<sub>apovldl2</sub> (with X representing a specific primer and apovldlII the promoter of an hepatocyte-specific gene, used as negative control), and error bars represent ± SD from three independent experiments.</p>

        <p>(A) Nuclease digestion analysis of a region 3 kb upstream of the transcription start site. Genomic DNA isolated from DNase I (right panel) and MNase (left panel)-treated chromatin, as well as control genomic DNA digested with MNase, were analyzed as described in the <xref rid="sec4" ref-type="sec">Experimental Procedures</xref>. HD11 cells were treated with LPS for 0–240 min. The deduced nucleosomal organization is depicted on the left part of the figure for nontreated HD11 cells and on the right for HD11 cells treated with LPS for 4 hr.
